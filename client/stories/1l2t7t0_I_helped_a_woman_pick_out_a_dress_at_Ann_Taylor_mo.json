  "description": "A few months back, I was waiting outside the fitting rooms at Ann Taylor while my daughter tried on clothes. A woman stepped out, clearly discouraged she had tried on a ton of things and still hadn’t found anything for what she said was her husband’s company Christmas party.\n\nShe glanced at me (lanyard around my neck, pen behind my ear rookie mistake!) and asked, “Can you help me find something that actually works?” I didn’t have the heart to tell her I didn’t work there.\n\nSo I just smiled and said, “Let’s do it.”\n\nWe spent about 20 minutes picking through racks. She was kind, funny, and I could tell she really wanted to feel good in her own skin again. Eventually, we found a dress that lit her up. She looked absolutely radiant.\n\nAs she beamed at herself in the mirror, she asked me, “How long have you worked here?” I laughed and told her the truth “Oh, I don’t work here I’m just waiting on my daughter.” We both cracked up. She gave me the biggest hug and said it was the most fun she’d had shopping in ages.\n\nI figured that was the end of it.\n\nUntil last week.\n\nI was grabbing coffee at a local bakery when someone tapped me on the shoulder. It was her! She recognized me right away and said, “You helped me find that dress! I’ve been hoping to run into you again. I wanted to say thank you properly.”\n\nWe sat down for coffee and ended up talking for nearly an hour. Turns out she wore the dress, felt amazing, had the best night in a long time and it sparked her to start putting herself out there again in all sorts of ways. She's now volunteering at a local women's group and just glowing with confidence.\n\nFunny how a small moment between strangers can ripple in ways you never expect.\n\nI’m so glad our paths crossed again. Some people really do stay with you.",
