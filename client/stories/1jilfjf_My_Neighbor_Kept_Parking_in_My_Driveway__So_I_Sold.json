  "description": "If you only read the title, I might sound like a lunatic. But trust me, he had it coming.\n\nI live in a quiet neighborhood with assigned driveways. My neighbor, Todd, decided that mine was also his personal parking space. At first, I was polite. I asked him to move. He apologized and said it wouldn't happen again.\n\nIt happened again. And again. And again.\n\nOne day, I came home to find his car parked there again—blocking me from my own garage. I knocked on his door. No answer. I called him. Straight to voicemail. I had places to be, and I was done playing nice.\n\nSo, I got creative. I called a towing company, but not to tow it away. I had it towed for sale.\n\nSee, Todd had left his car unlocked. And in my state, if a vehicle is left on private property without permission, the owner of the property can have it removed. I also happened to have a buddy who owned a tow yard, and he was more than happy to help. Within an hour, Todd’s car was on its way to an impound lot where it would be legally auctioned if he didn’t pay the fines.\n\nTodd showed up at my door that night, fuming. “Where’s my car?”\n\nI shrugged. “Not my problem. Maybe check the impound lot.”\n\nHe had to shell out a few hundred bucks to get it back. He never parked in my driveway again.",
