  "description": "My(25m) girlfriend(26) confessed to cheating on me last night, so I told her I’ve been cheating the whole time we’ve been together.  I had my suspicions that she’s been cheating as she’s been staying out late and just acting strange in general.\n\n Well, when she made her big announcement I replied by saying I’ve been cheating on her for the entirety of our relationship, which isn’t true. I told her I’ve been sleeping with 1 other women consistently and this drove her absolutely insane - like I genuinely thought she was going to do someone rash, like slash my tires or something. But no, she just screamed at me and demanded to know who she was. She went on to say she only cheated once and she was completely inebriated when it happened as if that someone absolves her of any wrongdoing. The audacity. \n\nwell anyways, I broke up with her and threw her out of my house. I then proceeded to invite the boys over for some bbq. All in all, it was a hilarious experience. I know it’s not a crazy story, but I thought it was funny enough to share.",
