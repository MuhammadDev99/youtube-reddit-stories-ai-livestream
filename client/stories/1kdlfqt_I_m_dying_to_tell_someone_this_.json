I don’t even know if you guys will believe me, but here goes.\n\nI wake up in the morning, ready for this incredible surprise. I’m so excited. I check my phone, and my long-term partner has told me he’s leaving me. That’s right, my boyfriend of over five years, the absolute love of my life, the person for whom I moved 1400 miles, and live with has broken up with me via text message. \n\nI’m staying at my mom‘s house in the town next-door, only 15 minutes drive from my friends house. I decided I will go a little bit early and stop at a shop to cheer myself up. While at the shop, I get a text message from my friend: https://imgur.com/a/shd6914\n\nNo problem, I go home, wonder what I’m going to do with the rest of my life, and wait for her text message.\n\nShe gets home from the vet, and I get her text message saying we can call anytime. I jump in the car, and try to think of an excuse for why I cannot call her back right away: https://imgur.com/a/EVGYspY\n\nLuckily, one of my good friends is in her 70s, and kind of like a mom, so I quickly think of this lie, and she 100% buys it. I can’t believe it.\n\nI get there, I managed to sneak to the door without being seen. I ring the doorbell, and no one answers. I’m not surprised. I ring it again, and her husband answers the door and he’s surprised. I’m convinced that he’s going to tell her, it’s me, but he doesn’t! He comes through for me, even though she’s bugging him to tell her who it is. \n\nSo I leaped out, she saw me and lost it. Then I lost it. Then we hugged. Then I took her down to the river landing, and we ate cupcakes and drank grape soda.\n\nIt was excellent, and although I loved all of your ideas about recording her reaction, I wouldn’t invade her privacy like that. And I need to preserve my anonymity too. \n\nThank you to everyone who got excited about this. It gave me joy during a difficult time. And I loved telling my friend about all of your well wishes. ♥️♥️♥️\n\n**Original Post**\n\nFive years ago I moved across the country. I was very close with my neighbor, and we almost never get to see each other. Her birthday is this weekend. I have flown into town for a funeral, but haven’t told a soul, and have kept it off social media. I can’t get her husband in on it because he will absolutely 100% tell her, so I’m the only person who knows my plan. \n\nI scheduled a Zoom “lunch” with her. She thinks I’m 1500 miles away, but I’ll be knocking on her door instead with cake. I can’t wait to surprise her! Thanks for listening. I love my friend so much. She’s a good person, and has been going through a rough time. I really hope this brings her a little joy.",
