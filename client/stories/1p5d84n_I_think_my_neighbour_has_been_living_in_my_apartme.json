  "description": "For context, I live alone in a small one-bedroom apartment. Nothing fancy. I work long shifts, so I’m usually gone from 8 AM to 7 PM. For months I’ve had this weird feeling that someone else has been inside my place — nothing dramatic, just small changes.\n\nStuff like:\n\n– My kitchen sponge being wet even when I haven’t used it.\n– The shower floor slightly damp when I always shower at night.\n– My cereal box moved a little to the left.\n– The toilet seat being up even though I live alone and don’t leave it like that.\n\nTiny things. Easy to shrug off. I kept telling myself I was imagining it.\n\nThen last month something happened that I couldn’t just explain away. I came home early with a migraine — like 1 PM early — and when I walked into my bedroom, my closet door was open. Wide open. I never leave it that way. I actually have this weird habit of double-checking it before leaving.\n\nI completely froze.\n\nI checked the whole apartment, every corner, behind every door. Nothing. No one. But the feeling wouldn’t leave.\n\nSo I bought a small, cheap, motion-activated camera on Amazon and hid it inside a fake plant on top of my fridge. It points toward the kitchen and hallway — basically the main path someone would take to get in or out.\n\nI put my phone on silent and went to work like normal.\n\nThe next day, around 2 PM, I got a notification on my phone:\n\n“Motion detected.”\n\nMy heart dropped so fast I couldn’t breathe. I ducked into a bathroom stall at work and opened the footage.\n\nAt first it looked normal.\nThen a hallway shadow moved.\n\nThen, from the left side of the frame, someone stepped into view.\n\nA man. Wearing a hoodie. Calm as if he lived there.\n\nHe walked straight to my fridge, opened it, took out my orange juice, sniffed it, made a face, and put it back. Then he opened my cutlery drawer, took out a fork, looked at it like he was judging me, and put it back in a different spot.\n\nHe didn’t steal anything.\nHe didn’t rush.\nHe didn’t seem nervous.\n\nHe was too comfortable.\n\nThe worst part: he walked down the hallway and went directly to my bedroom… and I never got footage of him coming back out. The camera only covered the kitchen.\n\nI left work immediately and called my best friend on the way. I was shaking so badly I almost dropped my keys. When I got home, everything was perfectly normal. No sign of anything disturbed.\n\nExcept the fork drawer.\nThat one detail made it real.\n\nI took the video to my landlord. He watched it three times, pale, and said:\n\n“I know who that is.”\n\nHe wouldn’t explain further, only that “it’s being handled.” I demanded he change my locks immediately. He did it within an hour, which makes me think he already knew there was a problem.\n\nHere’s the part that still kills me:\n\nThat night, around 11 PM, I heard footsteps above my bedroom.\n\nThere is no apartment above mine.\n\nOnly a locked storage attic that only the landlord has the key to.\n\nI asked him again the next day. He said I must’ve imagined it and refused to talk about it again.\n\nI bought a second camera.\nAnd a third.\n\nSince the locks were changed, nothing has happened. But sometimes I come home and I swear I can smell someone else’s cologne in my hallway.\n\nI don’t know what scares me more:\n\nThat someone was living in my apartment…\n\n…or that the landlord knew about it.",
