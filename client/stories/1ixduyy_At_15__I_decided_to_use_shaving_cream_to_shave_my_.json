  "description": "At 15, I decided to use shaving cream to shave my balls because sometimes it was hard to get them completely smooth. There were always a few stray hairs left. But as soon as I started shaving, I noticed that my balls were getting cold, and as I ran the razor over them, it burned even more. It felt like I had dipped my balls in liquid nitrogen. I rinsed with a bit of water to remove the cream, but the pain didn't go away. I panicked, sat naked on the bathroom floor, and started crying. The pain was unbearable, and at that moment, all sorts of thoughts raced through my head, like \"Can I still have kids?\" or \"Will they have to amputate?\" My mom heard me crying and asked if I was okay, but I was sobbing so much I couldn't answer. She told my dad to break down the door, and since my uncles were home, everyone came to the bathroom to see what was going on. My mom asked what had happened, and I begged them to take me to the hospital. She asked why, and I told her I had shaved with shaving cream. My dad and uncles started cracking up, and he told me to relax, that it would pass soon. I finished my shower and went straight to my room because I was so embarrassed. My balls stayed cold for about two more days.\n\nThis happened about four years ago, and now I'm almost 19.",
