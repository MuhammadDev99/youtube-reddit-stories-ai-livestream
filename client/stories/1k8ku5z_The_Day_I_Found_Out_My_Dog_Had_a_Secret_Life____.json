  "description": "So about two years ago, I adopted this golden retriever named Milo. Sweetest dog ever. Loves everyone. Typical golden energy — tail wagging so hard it could knock over a lamp.  \n\nWe live in a quiet neighborhood where a lot of people leave their gates open, and Milo has always been good about staying close to home. I trusted him enough to let him hang out in the front yard sometimes while I worked inside with the window open.  \n\nOne afternoon, I realized it had been a little \\*too\\* quiet for a while. I went outside to call him, and he wasn’t there. Full panic mode activated. I grabbed his leash and started running up and down the street yelling his name like a crazy person.  \n\nAbout three houses down, I saw something that made me stop dead in my tracks. ​ \nMilo...was sitting on someone else’s porch..... \n\nnd not just sitting. He was lounging like he \\*\\*owned\\*\\* the place. Head up, tongue out, happy as could be. And next to him? An older woman in a rocking chair, feeding him \\*pieces of chicken\\* from a plate.  \n\nI was like, “Uh...Milo??”  \n\nThe woman looked up and smiled and said,  \n“Oh, you must be Milo’s other family!”  \n\nOther family??\n\nTurns out, for MONTHS, Milo had been slipping away whenever I wasn’t looking and visiting this woman, Mrs. Patterson. She lived alone, her kids were grown, and apparently, Milo had just decided to adopt her. He’d show up every couple of days, sit politely on her porch, and she’d reward him with chicken, scraps, and the occasional bacon strip.  \n\nWe both laughed about it, and I apologized like a thousand times for him intruding, but she waved it off and said he was “good company.”  \n\nAfter that, we kind of made it official — Milo had two homes. I started bringing Mrs. Patterson groceries once a week, and Milo got to have his second grandma.  \n\nHe still splits his time between us, and honestly? I think he had the right idea.",
