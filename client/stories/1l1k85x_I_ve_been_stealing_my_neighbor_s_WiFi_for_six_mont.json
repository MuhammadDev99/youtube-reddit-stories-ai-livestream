  "title": "I've been stealing my neighbor's WiFi for six months and then they renamed it after me",
  "description": "It started when my internet died during a Zoom meeting. I was presenting quarterly reports and suddenly - frozen screen. Panic mode. I clicked on the WiFi icon on my laptop and saw all these networks. \"PrettyFlyForAWiFi\" - no lock symbol next to it. I clicked it, and it connected right away.\n\nI figured anyone who names their WiFi that has to be pretty chill. The meeting went fine. I meant to call my provider that afternoon, but then I forgot. And their internet was actually faster than mine ever was - YouTube videos started instantly, no buffering wheel. My old connection always had that annoying delay.\n\nWeeks went by. Then months. Every morning my laptop just connected automatically. I'd see that network name and smile - whoever this neighbor was, they had good taste in puns.\n\nLast week I was checking my phone at the coffee shop when I noticed the WiFi list. PrettyFlyForAWiFi was gone. Instead: \"OhaiCoffeeCat99.\"\n\nI nearly dropped my latte.\n\nCoffeeCat99. That's what I use on some games, chats and so on.\n\nMy stomach did this weird thing. How could they possibly know that was me? I don't understand any of this computer stuff, but can WiFi track who you are? Can they see my screen? Oh god, can they see which apartment the signal goes to?\n\nThe worst part is they're clearly still offering it. \"Ohai\" - like \"oh hi\" - specifically to CoffeeCat99. Which means they know it's me and they're... fine with it? But also means they've been able to see... what exactly?\n\nI don't even know which neighbor it is. Could be anyone in the building - the signal's strong enough from multiple floors.\n\nI called my internet company that same day. Turns out my service had never been cancelled, just some wire issue they \"forgot\" to fix. It's working again now, but every time I open my laptop I see \"OhaiCoffeeCat99\" in the network list.\n\nYesterday I left nice coffee beans outside every door on my floor with sticky notes: \"From a grateful neighbor :)\"\n\nIf they figured out I'm CoffeeCat99, they'll probably figure out the coffee is from me. If not, at least everyone gets free coffee.\n\nI still have no idea how they knew. Part of me wants to Google it, but honestly? They could have just turned on a password anytime in those six months. They didn't.\n\nThis morning I saw \"OhaiCoffeeCat99\" flash on my screen again when I opened my laptop. This time, I just smiled.",
