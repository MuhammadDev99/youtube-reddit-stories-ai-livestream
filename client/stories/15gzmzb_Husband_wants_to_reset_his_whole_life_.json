  "description": "Hi, I'm a 35 year old woman married to a 45 year old man for over 7 years. We have 4 beautiful kids. My husband recently had his birthday this week. I surprised him with a pregnancy test result that we will be having a 5th child. He seemed to have a meltdown when he heard it and he said no, it is impossible, we have been careful. I thought he would be happy as he said it himself when we were dating that he wants a lot of kids. I calmed him down somehow... Yesterday, I went with my husband to the gynecologist to have my sonogram and the doctor says I am 10 weeks pregnant and we are having twins. My husband was livid. He keeps screaming no no no no no. I lost count of him saying no. After his meltdown at doctors office he told me that he just can't have 6 kids at his age. I got confused as what he is saying- as I know he wanted a big family. he wanted it himself. I cried and told him what are we supposed to do and he keep saying that he just can't have 6 kids. On our way home he says how he should not have gotten married and have kids and he does not know anymore if his life is worth it, that he'd be happy to have a reset button. I got so mad I told him that it takes two to tango, that creating a kid is not just my fault. Today I woke up with screaming and crying kids begging their father to not go. Turns out he already packed and ready to go. My 3 year old is hugging his fathers luggage and crying and his face is stoic. By then I knew I was stupid to committing a mistake of marrying him. It maybe hard as I am pregnant right now, but I got a full time job and we do have a nanny and supportive family and friends. It is best if he go, I do not need another baby to take care of. So, to my dear soon to be ex-husband Jerry, F\\*CK YOU. don't come back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
