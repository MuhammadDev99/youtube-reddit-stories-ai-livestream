  "description": "My dad was a brilliant guy. He got a Master's in aerospace engineering and retired Lt Col in the USAF. During his career he was a fight test engineer on he F-117 stealth program. That gig meant he was flown \"out to the desert\" as he would say, for weeks at a time. He has never said much about the places and people and things he saw, but one day when I was about 20 years old I asked him directly \"is there alien technology at Area 51?\" and his response has stuck with me all these years. He said \"Son, people underestimate the intelligence of humans.\" Take that for what you will.",
