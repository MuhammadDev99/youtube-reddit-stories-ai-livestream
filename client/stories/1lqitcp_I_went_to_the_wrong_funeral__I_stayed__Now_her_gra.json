  "description": "I was in a new city. A week in, I got a text from a number I didn’t recognize:\n\n“Hey, service is at 3. Wear something dark, she hated bright colors. I know you didn’t know her well, but it would mean a lot if you came.”\n\nI stared at it. I wasn’t sure who it was meant for. But it felt… urgent. Like maybe they really needed someone there. And I had nothing else to do.\n\nSo, I went.\n\nI pulled up to the church a few minutes early. Sat in the back. No one questioned me. I figured maybe it was a distant coworker or a college friend. I kept waiting for someone to say, “Wait, who are you?” But they didn’t.\n\nThe woman who had passed her name was Marion had the kindest smile I’ve ever seen. I learned about her love for jazz, her cat named Newton, and how she never let anyone leave her house without taking a cookie. I sat through every eulogy like I’d known her forever.\n\nAfterward, during the gathering, her grandmother approached me.\n\n“You were her friend from art class, weren’t you?” she asked.\n\nI froze. “No, I think I got the wrong text.”\n\nShe laughed. Actually laughed. “So you’re just… here? For a stranger?”\n\nI nodded. “Didn’t want her to have an empty room.”\n\nShe grabbed my hand and said, “Then you’re exactly the kind of person she would’ve liked.”\n\nWe sat together for hours. Talking about Marion. About grief. About weird coincidences. Before I left, her grandma gave me a small velvet pouch.\n\n“Take this,” she said. “Marion would’ve insisted you didn’t leave empty-handed.”\n\nInside was a single sugar cookie, shaped like a heart.\n\nA year later, her grandmother still sends me a birthday card. Always with a cookie recipe inside. I send her a handwritten thank you every time.\n\nI don’t know why I went that day. But I’m glad I did.\n\nSometimes the wrong funeral is exactly where you’re meant to be.",
