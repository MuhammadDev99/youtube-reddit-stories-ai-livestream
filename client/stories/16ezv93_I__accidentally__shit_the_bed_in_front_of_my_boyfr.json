  "description": "WARNING! don't read this if you have any problems with feces and that kind of shit (pun intended) \nSomeone told me that I should share this embarrassing story so here we go. (Disclaimer, English isn't my first language, so I'm sorry for all the spelling/grammar mistakes)\n\nMe [F18] had just gotten in a relationship with my new sweet boyfriend [M20]. \nA little info about me. I have a chronic stomach wound which pops up whenever I'm really stressed. \n\nThe relationship was very new so we were both still quite shy, we had just gotten comfortable enough farting in front of each other tho, and often made a joke out of it. \nAbout a month into our relationship I had to go to the hospital with my stomach wound, I was there for a week and he was super supportive the whole time. \nWhen I finally got home from the hospital my body was so weak, I wasn't allowed to drink or eat anything the whole week because of the tests they had to make. Therefore my body had pretty much shut down, nothing had come in, so nothing came out. I got prescribed some laxatives that I took, never having taken them before I didn't know what to expect but it definitely wasn't this! \nWe were laying in bed, I was on my side looking at my phone, and he was half sitting up in bed playing RuneScape on his laptop in front of me. I could feel a fart coming, so I looked up into his eyes with a smirk face expression and said: \"I'm shitting!\" \n\nI meant to say \"I'm farting\" but the words came out wrong.. and so did something else. The moment I said it, I let it all out, still with a smirk face expression looking him right in the eyes. You could hear a wet bubbly sound, and I instantly knew what had happened. My smile fated and my face turned to horror, my hand flew down to stop the flow but it was too late. Boyfriend jumped up and ran to the toilet to bring me paper, he helped me clean up while just laughing hysterically, I was so embarrassed that I couldn't even say anything. \n\nLater when we sat and talked he told me that it was the most intimidating thing he had ever experienced, the way I looked right into his eyes, he had never felt so dominated in his life. \"Like a monkey shitting in its hand and throwing it\". \nNeedless to say we got very quickly comfortable with intimate things like that after this. \nEven tho we've broken up since then and it's been a few years, I'm to this day still just as embarrassed.",
