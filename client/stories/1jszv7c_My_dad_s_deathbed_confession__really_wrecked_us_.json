  "description": "Three months ago, this man, this ghost we thought had been dead for, like, twenty years... just showed up. Knocked on my mom’s door like it was no big deal.\n\nAnd let me paint the picture for you: scruffy gray beard, hollow cheeks, dragging this busted, seen-too-much-shit leather suitcase like it owed him rent. My older sister Laura opened the door. She almost passed out. Legit. I thought she was gonna throw up or deck him or both.\n\nTo really get it, you gotta go back.\n\nMom always said our dad was a hero. A journalist locked up overseas for speaking out against some messed-up regime. Fighting for truth, freedom of the press, all that. Then, a few years later, came the news: he died in prison from untreated pneumonia. No funeral. Just a tragedy and a handful of ashes we never saw\n\nThe End. Period. That was the version we grew up with.The only one we knew.The only one we believed.\n\nLaura? hated him. Even with the martyr story, she never forgave him for leaving. She always said: Doesn’t matter how noble the excuse,, gone is still gone.\n\nSo when she saw him standing there, all she said and voice shaking with fury, not surprise, was: You don’t get to be here.\n\nMy brother Michael? Different vibe. He’s quiet. Always thinking, always feeling more than he lets on. He stared at Dad for what felt like forever, like he was trying to figure out if this was real life or a dream. Then just asked: How’d you get out of prison? And… why now?\"\n\nMe? I didn’t even know what I felt. It wasn’t hate. Wasn’t joy either. It was like the ground disappeared under my feet. I’d built this whole version of him in my head. This myth. This tragic hero. And standing there was just… a tired old man.\n\nFor weeks, he was like a ghost floating around the edges of our lives.\n\nMom? Not having it. She shut that door on any second chances. SWouldn’t dig up that past she'd already buried.\n\nSo guess who took him in?\n\nAunt freaking Bertha. \n\nShe said the poor guy had nowhere else to go. So, she gave him a dusty little room in the back of her house. He didn’t argue. Just nodded.\n\nAnd then, one day, his body just… gave up.\n\nThe hospital ran a ton of tests. Nothing made sense. His immune system was shutting down but there was no infection, no cancer, like something inside him was rotting...\n\nAunt Bertha was crushed. Said he wasn’t eating. Barely slept. Claimed it was stress, guilt, all those years of hiding catching up with him. Dad kept saying his mouth felt gross. Headaches that wouldnt quit. Like something was rotting him from the inside.\n\nThen, right before he died, he asked to see us. All of us.Not for love.Not for forgiveness, nope. Just… truth or to drop a bomb and peace out.\n\n\n\nHe could barely speak, but he was stubborn. Wouldn’t rest till he got it out.\n\nDad: I was in prison but Not for long, yeah, I was involved in politics. But they let me go after a few months. I didn’t come back because…(he looked at us. All three of us) because I found out you weren’t my biological kids.\n\nSilence. My brain? Cracked\n\nHe went on.\"Your mom wrote me a letter while I was locked up. Said she loved me. But she’d lied. She told me the truth in that letter.\"\n\n\"I felt like everything in my life was fake. So I disappeared. I faked my death. Hid.\"\n\nHe didn’t cry. He just talked. Like he’d been carrying this weight so long and now he was finally allowed to put it down.\n\nAnd we just… stood there. Statues. Broken. No one said a damn word.\n\n-§-\n\nEdit: Update****\nI think it is too long for sharing in a post (just adding another part)\n\nAfter he died, things got weird. Not at first. \n\nAunt Bertha called me two days after the funeral. Said she couldnt stay in the house. Said the room where he slept felt wrong and heavy. She swore she kept hearin something scratching inside the closet at night. But when she checked, nothing. Just dust and his old suitcase, still zipped up, still sitting where he left it\n\nThat thing freaked me out. Idk why. It was just a damn suitcase. But every time I looked at it, I felt like it was looking back. \n\nMichael opened it. That’s his thing. So he did.\n\nThere wasnt much inside. A couple of shirts, a half-used bar of soap wrapped in paper (ew), some faded photos of people we didnt recognize. And this notebook. Leather-bound. No title. Just stuffed with pages of cramped handwriting.\n\nWe took it home. Dumb idea.\n\nThe first few pages were what you'd expect. Random notes. Political crap. Names. Numbers. But then the tone shifted. Got paranoid. Obsessive. He started writing like someone was watching him. Following him. There were pages scratched out so hard the paper tore.\n\nThere was an another note, dated just a few days before he died. One of the last things he wrote:\n\n'That night I couldnt sleep. My mouth tasted weird. Bitter. Metallic. Like I’d been chewing on aluminum foil\"\n\nLaura wanted to burn it. Straight up tossed it in the sink and lit a match. But the damn thing wouldn’t catch. It blackened around the edges but never really burned. \n\nThe next day I went to see Mom. She looked worse than I’ve ever seen her. Like she’d aged ten years in a week.\n\nShe didnt even say hi, just stared out the window\n\nEventually, I got the nerve to ask her about the letter, okay, the one she sent Dad when he was in prison. The one that made him disappear.I told her I wanted the Truth. About everything and about him and about us. \n\nAbout who our father really was\n\nOr if he was even the only one\n\nShe didnt speak. Just turned her head slowly and gave me this look cold and scared at the same time. Like she wanted to tell me, but her mouth wouldnt let her.And then she said: What the hell are you talking about? Are you high again?\n\nAnd She walked away.\n\nThat night, Laura called hysterical. Said she found Michael in the bathtub. Not dead. Not bleeding. Just sitting there, fully clothed, muttering to himself...over and over:\n\n“He wasn’t supposed to come back. He wasn’t supposed to come back”\n\nWe checked him into a clinic the next day. He hasn’t said a word since.\n\nNow it’s just me. Me and this notebook I cannot seem to throw away. \n\nWell, Sometimes I think I see him. My dad. In reflections. In places he shouldn be.\n\nLike he never left.\n\nLike he’s still watching us\n\nSo, I went to Aunt Bertha’s place to ask her about it all. I needed answers. She let me in but there was something… off about her. Her eyes were too wide, like she hadn slept; her hands shook when she poured me a drink. She kept glancing over her shoulder, as someone might walk in.\n\nI asked her about the suitcase. She didn answer right away. Then after a long silence, she finally spoke so soft I almost didn hear it:\n\n“I loved him”\n\nWHAT??\n\n***\nYou ever wonder what mercury actually does to the body?\n\nP.S.
