  "description": "Had a rough morning this morning. Dealing with depression. I'm in therapy for it and taking medication so I'm on the road to recovery but I still have tough days.  \n\n\nThis morning I had a break down. I was being really down on myself and had a lot of self disgust. But my son needed a wipe for his runny nose. So I went to get him one and accidentally spilled something on the way. It was the straw that broke the camels back. I collapsed on the floor and started sobbing.   \n\n\nNormally I try my best to do my crying out of my son's view. I don't want him to worry about his dad. I want to be a rock for him. Strong and stable. But in this moment I couldn't help it.   \n\n\nBut when my son noticed me crying I couldn't have been prouder. He came up to me and said \"why are you crying daddy\" and I said through my sobbing... \"I don't know....\"  \n\n\nHe gave me as big of a hug as his little arms could and he said \"It's okay daddy.\"   \n\n\nHe ran over to his wipes and brought them over to me and tried to dry my eyes. He asked me to blow my nose. I did. He grabbed the tissue from me and said \"It's okay I throw that away for you daddy.\"  \n\n\nI grabbed him and gave him the biggest squeeze. He said \"You better now?\" and I said \"I'm better now\"  \n\n\nI'm so lucky.\n\nEdit: thank you all for your support❤️❤️🤗🤗. I wasn't expecting all this attention so again thank you all and i will promise to be strong❤️❤️💪💪",
