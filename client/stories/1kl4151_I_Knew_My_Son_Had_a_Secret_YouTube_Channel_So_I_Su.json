  "description": "I’m 42, not exactly a tech-savvy dad. But I keep up. I know what Twitch is, I can operate Discord without setting something on fire, and I know YouTube isn’t just cat videos anymore.\n\nMy son’s 17. Quiet kid, keeps to himself. Great student, respectful, but always in his room, editing stuff, talking to his screen when he thinks no one’s listening. I knew he was up to something, and I figured it out pretty quickly:\nHe had a YouTube channel.\n\nHe never told us. He’d switch tabs whenever someone walked in. Got real nervous if we touched his laptop. Typical teenage secrecy, I thought.\n\nSo one day while dropping him off for coaching, I noticed a tab open just for a second. The channel name: “NexusTalks.”\n\nDidn’t say anything. Just noted it.\n\nLater that night, I looked it up on my phone. 37K subscribers.\n\nMy son was lowkey internet famous.\n\nBut that wasn’t even the wild part.\nThe videos? They weren’t gaming or cringe memes. They were these raw, deep commentary clips—about school pressure, friendships, loneliness, being misunderstood. About growing up feeling invisible, even in your own home.\n\nIt hit me hard.\n\nHe was funny, articulate, real. And yeah—he talked about us.\nNothing disrespectful. But honest.\n\n&gt; “My parents are good people. They care. But they don’t always get me. I don’t know if they’d support this channel if they knew. Maybe they’d laugh. Maybe they’d tell me to focus on real stuff.”\n\n\n\nI didn’t sleep much that night.\nBecause the truth is—I hadn’t really seen him in a while.\nI’d been so focused on work, bills, routine… I forgot to check in on who he was becoming.\n\nSo I subscribed. Liked every video. Left one anonymous comment under a vid titled “Why I’m Afraid To Be Myself At Home.”\n\n&gt; “Any parent would be proud of you. Never stop being you.”\n\n\n\nHe didn’t reply. But the next day, he walked into the living room and sat beside me. No phone. No distractions. Just sat.\n\nThen said, “Hey, uh… if I wanted to show you something I’ve been working on… would that be okay?”\n\nI nodded.\nHe smiled a little. Like something heavy had finally lifted.\n\nAnd that’s how I found out about my son’s YouTube channel.\n\nNot by spying. Not by confronting.\n\nBut by listening.",
