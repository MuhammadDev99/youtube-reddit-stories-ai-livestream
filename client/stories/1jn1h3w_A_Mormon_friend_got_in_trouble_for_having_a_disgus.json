  "description": "I went to Air Force basic training like 6 years ago. They took away our phones on day one, and we didn't get them back until 10 weeks later. I remember when I finally got to look at it after so long, it was like the brightest, most beautiful thing I had ever seen in my life.\n\nAt technical school, we were living in a dorm-like building, and there was a Whatsapp group chat the \"airman leaders\" made for everyone in the building. Its intended purpose was to dole out the chores and cleaning responsibilities.\n\n...but that group chat rapidly turned into a waste land for the weirdest, most depraved memes you've ever seen. These 18-year-old kids who just got all their phones back had *absolutely no chill.* My phone was pinging at all hours of the day and night as a torrent of weird memes poured into the group chat.\n\nThe airman leaders kept posting that memes were not allowed in the group chat, but the 18-year-old masses were unstoppable. They were equipped with a seemingly endless arsenal of fucked-up memes.\n\nOne day somebody posted a meme that was a four-panel comic of a thicc Winnie-the-Pooh. He was wearing a thong and a bra, and he had a jar of honey stuck on his head. He was bumbling around, knocking everything in his house over with his thicc ass and his huge, juicy tits as he tried to get the jar of honey off his head.\n\nWell, that turned out to be the straw that broke the camel's back. The mods of the Whatsapp group chat changed the settings so that only they could post messages.\n\nBut after that, they only posted about the chores once a week, and they didn't delete any of the memes, so that thicc Winnie-the-Pooh meme was still visible on the group chat for weeks. \n\nMy Mormon friend Terry went to dinner with his wife, and she happened to see the thicc Winnie-the-Pooh meme on his phone. She was inconsolable; she could not understand why her devout, religious husband would have such a disgusting thing on his phone.\n\nIt actually turned into a big deal in their marriage. One day he brought her to morning formation so he could prove to her that the thicc Winnie-the-Pooh wasn't just on his phone. Me and a bunch of other airmen pulled out our phones and opened the Whatsapp group chat to show her that the meme was on our phones too.\n\nI'll never forget the unfathomable look on that poor little Mormon girl's face as her eyes darted frantically from one thicc Winnie-the-Pooh to the next in the early morning light...",
