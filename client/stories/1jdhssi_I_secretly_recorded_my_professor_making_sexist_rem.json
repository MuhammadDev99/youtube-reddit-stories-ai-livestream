  "description": "I (26M) am in my final year of university, and I had a professor let's call him, Dr. R, who always made weird, inappropriate comments. At first, I thought he was just old-fashioned, but over time, I realized he was blatantly sexist.\n\nIt started subtly, he would call on male students more often and dismiss female students' answers as \"lucky guesses.\" But as the semester went on, his comments became worse. He once said in class, \"Women just aren’t as naturally gifted in logic-based subjects,\" and another time, when a girl asked a question, he laughed and said, \"If female students spent less time worrying about their looks and more time studying, maybe they’d get better grades.\" Whenever we had a difficult topic, he’d smirk and say, \"This might be a little hard for the girls, but don’t worry, just smile at your lab partners, and they’ll help you out.\"\n\nThen one day, he completely crossed the line. A girl in my class wore a tank top because it was hot outside, nothing inappropriate, just normal summer wear. He paused the lecture and said, \"Wow, dressing like that for extra credit? Bold strategy.\" Some people laughed awkwardly, but the girl looked mortified. She barely spoke for the rest of the class.\n\nThat was when I decided to start recording. Over the next few weeks, I captured multiple instances of him making sexist comments. The worst was when he joked that women should focus on \"easier\" fields because STEM was \"too stressful for them.\" That one pissed me off because there were girls in the class working their asses off, and he was acting like they didn’t belong there.\n\nI compiled everything and submitted it anonymously to the university’s disciplinary committee. They launched an investigation, and within a month, Dr. R was fired.\n\nNow, some of my classmates, mostly the guys, are pissed at me. They say I \"ruined a man’s career over a few jokes\" and that I should have just ignored him. But a lot of the female students have thanked me, saying they’ve been uncomfortable in his class for years.\n\nEdit: My best friend was cursing the person who got him fired in front of me. I told him it was me, and he told this to everyone around.\n\nEdit: My best friend was cursing the person who got him fired in front of me.

You all couldn't digest that some man could do this.",
