  "description": "Hi there, yes I did go to the police. Before I did I decided to look through the camera feed to see if there had been any more occasions of him hitting her. It had happened once before. We have one of the ones where we can access it from our phones, incase anyone is confused. I did as some of you said and took pictures of her bruises.\n\nI did take the footage to the police. His mother found out and called me enraged, saying how could I ruin a good man's life. I simply hung up on her and blocked her. Legal shit is going on, and when I was checking the camera I saw he'd done exactly as I thought he would. He ended up destroying some of the stuff I left behind, such as my grandmother's China collection she left behind, some pictures of me and my family, my favorite dress, and some stuff I had been collecting so we could get a dog. So I'm taking that to the police as well.\n\nSorry this isn't a big update it's only been like a week. I might update when this is all over.",
