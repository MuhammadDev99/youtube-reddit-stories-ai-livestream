  "description": "In college I met a girl at a house party. We drank and talked. Drank and talked. Drank and talked. Starting kissing. Tongues and all. \n\nShe asked me to the restroom with her. Of course, I said. She took me by the hand and led me away.  I went in first and she shut the door behind her and locked it. \n\nI was certain things were about to go to the next level. She said hang on and unzipped her pants. Sat down on the toilet. \n\nI thought she had to pee. Then she grunted. I heard a fart. Then a plop. \n\nI unlocked the door and ran. Never saw her again.",
