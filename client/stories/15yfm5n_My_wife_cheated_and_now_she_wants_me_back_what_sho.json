  "description": "My wife had got home from work late which wasn’t unusual for her since she usually had night shifts but last week she came back sweaty and was acting strange I decided to check her messages and that’s when I found it a string of messages between her and another man I confronted her about it and she began to cry saying how sorry she was but I just got her out the door ever since she has been texting me how sorry she was but I don’t think I can forgive her what should I do \n\n(A few hours after this post) I have decided after reading all the comments and advice that I’m going to divorce her I text her I’m going to divorce her and she just begged me not to but I decided I’m going through with it I just can’t forgive her that’s it for now anything more happens I’ll update on this Post thank you for all the support and comments it means a lot.",
