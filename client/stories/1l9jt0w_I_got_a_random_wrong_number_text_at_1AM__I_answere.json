  "description": "&gt;A little over a year ago, I got a text at 1:04 AM:  \nis the green one better or the gold one?? pls answer fast\"  \n  \nNo name. No context. Just that.I was half-asleep, but something about it made me laugh. I replied:\n\n&gt;Green. Always go with the green one.\"  \n  \nTwo minutes later:\n\n&gt;OK THANK YOU. i’m freaking out. i think i love him?? and idk if this is a date?? it’s like... a maybe-date  \n  \nI didn’t have the heart to say “wrong number,” so I just said:\n\n&gt;“Then wear the green. Look good. Feel better. And maybe-date the hell out of it.”  \n  \nShe texted back:\n\n&gt;“You’re literally a stranger but i love you. thank you. 💚”  \nAnd that was it.Or so I thought.Because a week later, she texted again.  \n  \n“Green was the right call. It *was* a date. His name’s Eli. He smelled like cedar and stress.”And I, some random dude who never said she had the wrong number.... texted back.And we just… kept texting. Every few days. Then every day. For months.She never asked who I was. I never told her. It became this anonymous thread of support. When things went well, she’d send me updates. When things went badly, I’d hype her up like I was her invisible best friend in the walls.Eventually, she named me “Text Goblin.”Then, one night in November, she sent this:\n\n&gt;“Okay Goblin. I told him I love him. And he said it back. I’m so scared. I feel like my heart is too big and soft for this world.”  \nI texted back something dumb, like:\n\n&gt;“He’s lucky to have you. And green was still the right choice.”  \nThen I didn’t hear from her for two months.  \nI thought it was over. Until January.\n\n&gt;“I found out who you are.”  \nI froze.\n\n&gt;“You used your real Spotify once. That’s how I found your playlist. Then your profile.”  \nMy heart dropped.\n\n&gt;“I’m not mad. I actually have a question.”\n\n&gt;“Will you come to my wedding?”\n\n&gt;“As my Text Goblin.”  \nAnd that’s how I ended up flying to Arizona last month, standing in a room full of strangers, watching a woman I’ve never met walk down the aisle, wearing a green ribbon in her hair, and winking at me from across the crowd.We hugged after. She whispered, “Thank you for picking green.  \n”And I said, “It was always green.”  \nI do totally apologize coz i forgot her real name because I was so mesmerized by chaotic possible chances in the whole world.Still saved in my phone as “Possibly Chaos.”  \nLife is weird. But sometimes weird is kind.",
