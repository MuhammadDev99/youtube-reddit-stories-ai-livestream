  "description": "If you only read the title, I might sound like a bad guy. But I'm not.\n\nI've known I wanted to be childfree since my early teens.\n\nMy parents didn't oppose me, but they did say I could change my mind. Since I'm not an only child, they'll still get grandchildren. When I was 20, I got a vasectomy. When I was 22, I met my girlfriend. I've been open about wanting to be childfree from the very beginning. I remember telling her about my vasectomy, but to be honest, I think there was already alcohol involved. So I'm not sure if she remembers.\n\nWe were dating for a year and a half when she moved in with me. I'm now 25. Two weeks ago, I got home from work, and my girlfriend was standing in the living room smiling. She showed me the positive pregnancy test. Thinking it was a TikTok prank, I played along. When she didn't reveal it was a prank, I knew what had happened, but I continued playing along.\n\nThat night, I got up at midnight and started sending emails. I took a week off work and emailed my best friends the details, telling them to pretend they knew nothing and be prepared. The next morning, I left for work as usual, but I didn't go to work. Carl, one of my friends, was waiting outside. He had a cap and a hoodie ready for me. The whole week, we followed Katie, and on day 3, she met up with her affair partner. We followed them to a motel, and then Carl followed him to his home. The guy was married with kids.\n\nWe devised a plan. I convinced Katie to go to her parents' house to tell them the good news last Saturday. While there, I gave my friends the keys to my home. At Katie's parents' house, we had lunch with the parents and siblings first, and then Katie told them the good news. Everyone was happy. After a while, I got a call I had to take. It was my friends telling me they were done and ready. So I asked to make an announcement. I pulled Katie aside in front of everyone. I bet they thought I was going to propose. I started by telling how we met, how much she meant to me, and ended with, \"And that's why it hurt so much that you cheated on me and got pregnant by someone else.\" The room was silent. Katie looked shocked. She started telling me it wasn't a funny joke. I said I'm not joking. The moment you told me you were pregnant, I knew you cheated. I got a vasectomy five years ago, and I go to check-ups every year. So if you're pregnant, you have cheated.\n\nAt that moment, her phone rang. I told her to answer it. It was probably \\[AP's full name\\]. You know, the REAL father of your baby. Probably wants to talk about you moving in. Not sure if his wife and kids are going to like that.\n\nWhat happened was that my friends had loaded up everything of Katie's in a U-Haul and brought it to AP's home. When they called me, they were in front of his home for the final part. They rang the doorbell and asked the AP where they could put her things. He was confused, and they handed him and his wife a folder with pictures of him and Katie. And Carl said, \"Since OP is kicking her out, she needs a place to stay. We're just here delivering her things. And since you don't want the woman who is pregnant with your child to stay on the street, we assumed you would take her in.\" AP called Katie yelling that she ruined his life and he never wants to see her again.\n\nAfter hearing him scream over the phone, I said, \"Oh, so his wife doesn't want his mistress and their affair baby living there. So you'll have to stay here. With your parents\"  \nWith that, I walked away, leaving a crying Katie and her confused and angry family behind. My friends brought the U-Haul with her stuff to her parents' house after the AP refused to accept it.\n\nI went home where my sister was waiting for me. She knew everything. This was not part of my plan, but Carl knows me so well. I broke down and cried in my sister's arms. She stayed the weekend taking care of me, allowing me to grieve and process the betrayal.\n\n  \n[Small update](https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1ez3vb9/my_girlfriend_told_me_she_was_pregnant_so_i_had/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",
