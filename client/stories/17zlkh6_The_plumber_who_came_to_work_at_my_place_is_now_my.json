  "description": "Yes, yes, it sounds like a plot from an adult film. At the beginning of the year, my sink started leaking, and since I live in an apartment, my landlord scheduled an appointment with a plumber to fix it. I left work early, and it happened to be the first snowstorm of the year. I got completely stuck in the snow with my car in front of my place. The plumber was already there, working on plumbing at my neighbor's. Still stuck in the snow, my neighbor came to warn me that the plumber was waiting. I was frustrated with my car situation. I went inside, opened the door, and saw this incredibly handsome guy. I was momentarily speechless. After finally managing to free my car from the snow, I went inside. I'm quite introverted and shy in life, but I awkwardly tried to make conversation. We spoke strangely, as if we knew each other. When he finished, we said goodbye, and he left. Later, he returned and rang my doorbell. I thought he had probably forgotten something, but he asked for my phone number! I was so happy; we started texting, and on our first date, everything felt so natural. I felt comfortable with him like never before. Today, we're a couple, and he lives with me. I'm dating my plumber.",
