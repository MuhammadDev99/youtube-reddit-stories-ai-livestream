  "description": "I was on a bus after work when the strap on my tote snapped and my day hit the floor. Wallet, tampons, a glass jar of soup, my spare flats. The jar cracked and soup slid toward the driver like it had somewhere to be. I froze. The bus did that collective inhale.\n\nA woman in scrubs blocked the stream with her lunch container. A teenager swept my stuff into his hoodie. The guy with paint under his nails pulled blue tape from a pouch and wrapped my strap like a pit stop. Napkins moved row to row. The driver eased to the curb and passed me a trash bag, calm. For three stops we were a tiny assembly line.\n\nBy my stop the mess was gone and my bag held together. People gave me a clap. I laughed so hard I almost cried and stepped into the evening feeling steadier than I had all week. You ever watch strangers build a team around you in ten seconds",
