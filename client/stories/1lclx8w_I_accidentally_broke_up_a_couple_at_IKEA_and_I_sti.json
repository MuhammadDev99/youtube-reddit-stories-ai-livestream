  "description": "So this happened around 3 years ago and still lives rent-free in my head. I (29 at the time) had gone to IKEA on a Sunday afternoon aka chaos hour. I was just looking for a stupid desk lamp, but IKEA being IKEA, I ended up wandering around like I was in Narnia.\n\nAnyway, I’m in the kitchen section when I overhear a couple arguing about what kind of plates to get. Not just, “I like this one better,” but a full-on relationship crisis disguised as dinnerware shopping.\n\nThe guy says something like, “We always do what *you* want, why are we even here?” and the girl replies, “Because you never make decisions!” Classic stuff.\n\nNow here’s where I become the accidental villain.\n\nI walk by them and spot the exact lamp I’ve been hunting for in someone’s abandoned cart nearby. I point and say, “Sorry, do you know where that lamp is from?” But apparently, that cart belonged to the guy in the couple. He snaps, “I don’t know, just take it!” and storms off.\n\nThe girl looks at me, goes, “Seriously?” and then follows him while muttering something like, “Can’t even buy f\\*\\*\\*ing plates without drama.”\n\nI felt like a background character who just delivered the line that ruined a whole subplot. I left with the lamp feeling like I had triggered a breakup.\n\nTo this day, I wonder:  \nDid they make up in the parking lot?  \nDid she throw a dinner plate at him later?  \nDid I accidentally do her a favor?\n\nAnyway, IKEA remains undefeated in turning shopping trips into emotional warzones.",
