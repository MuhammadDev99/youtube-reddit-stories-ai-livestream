  "description": "It was ten minutes to my interview. I ducked into the lobby bathroom shaking. Coffee down my blouse. Mascara smudge. Breath too fast.\n\nThree women took one look and moved like a tiny pit crew. One dabbed the stain with a stain pen. One blasted the hand dryer and fanned my shirt. One found a small safety pin and fixed a loose button. Another slid me a mint. Someone smoothed my hair and tied it back. We all laughed when the dryer roared like a jet.\n\nThey stood in a loose line and sent me out with a nod. later I came back to the same tiles and told them I got it. We clapped in that echo room. A stranger wiped a tear and called me kiddo. I walked out taller in a clean blouse that smelled like floral soap and mint, held up by people I met for five minutes.",
