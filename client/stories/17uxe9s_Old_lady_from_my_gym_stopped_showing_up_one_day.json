  "description": "I started going to the gym a little while ago to start taking better care of myself. There was an old lady who went everyday at the same time. She would spend hours there just stretching and walking. Originally I paid her no mind as I like to keep to myself during workouts.\n\nAfter about three weeks of going 5 days a week she came up to talk to me. We were the only two in the gym and she forgot her headphones. She asked if I was okay with her playing her podcast out loud. I said it was fine since I had my own headphones in and wouldn’t hear it. She continued to talk to me everyday after that.  She told me she was there 7 days a week. I learned a lot about her. She was always there for 2-3 hours in the afternoon. \n\nA couple weeks ago she told me she was moving as her place was too expensive. She had two weeks left but said she’d still come to the gym. That was the last time I saw her in the gym. \n\nI went there at the same hours she always used to go. I spent extra time some days to see if she was just running late. She never showed up. I’m not sure what happened to her, all I know is that her two weeks are up at her place. It makes me a bit sad that I won’t see her anymore. I hope she’s doing okay.",
