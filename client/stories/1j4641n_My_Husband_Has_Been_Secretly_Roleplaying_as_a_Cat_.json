  "description": "I (27F) just found out my husband (30M) has been pretending to be a cat online for THREE YEARS and I don't know what to do.\n\nOkay, so I'm literally shaking while typing this. My husband and I have been married for five years, together for seven. He's always been kind of... quirky? Like he talks to our cat in full sentences but I thought it was just cute or whatever.\n\nLast night, I was using his laptop because mine died, and I noticed his Reddit was still logged in. I know, I know, I shouldn't have snooped but something in me told me to look.\n\nY'all. This man... this GROWN MAN... has been running a whole-ass cat roleplay account for THREE YEARS. He writes in first person AS A CAT. Like, \"Human forgot to feed me today. Vengeance will be swift. Time to knock glass from high place.\"\n\nBut that's not even the worst part.\n\nHe's... popular. Like top posts, awards, thousands of followers. People genuinely think he's a cat. He has INTERNET FRIENDS that think they're talking to some sassy British shorthair named Mr. Whiskers. He gets into fights with other cat accounts about territory and kibble brands.\n\nI went into the rabbit hole and this man has a full-fledged CAT NEMESIS named Sir Pounce-a-Lot. They have BEEF. There's literal fanfiction of their rivalry in the comments.\n\nWhen I confronted him, he just sighed and went, \"You weren't supposed to find out like this.\"\nLIKE. FIND OUT WHAT, SIR? THAT I MARRIED WARRIOR CATS FANFIC ROLEPLAY TUMBLR IN HUMAN FORM??\n\nI don't know what to do. He's the love of my life but I can't look at him without imagining him typing out \"Mlem. The humans have displeased me once again.\"\n\nDo I divorce him? Do I make an account and become his rival? How do I move forward from this?",
