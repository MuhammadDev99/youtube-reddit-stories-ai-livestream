  "description": "If you only read the title, I might seem like a petty employee. But trust me, this was long overdue.\n\nI’ve worked at my company for two years. My boss, Mike, had a habit of dumping extra work on me at the last minute. Always after hours. Always \"urgent.\" At first, I thought it was normal, but then I noticed a pattern. My coworkers never got these late-night emails. Just me.\n\nOne night, he told me I had to stay late to finish a report he conveniently \"forgot\" to assign earlier. I had plans. I pushed back. He got weirdly aggressive, hinting that my dedication would \"affect my future here.\"\n\nThat’s when I started digging. I searched my inbox and found months of these \"urgent\" emails. Most weren’t even necessary. Some even contradicted deadlines he had given others. Then I remembered something. HR had mentioned during onboarding that all emails were backed up on the company server.\n\nSo, I did what any overworked employee would do. I forwarded everything to HR with a polite inquiry:\n\n\"Hey, I just wanted some clarification. I seem to be receiving significantly more after-hours requests than my peers. Is this standard practice?\"\n\nI didn’t hear anything for a week. Then, out of nowhere, Mike called me into his office. He looked pale. HR had flagged the pattern, compared workloads, and found a lot more than just unfair treatment. Turns out, Mike had been diverting work from his own responsibilities onto me while claiming credit for my results.\n\nA week later, an all-company email announced that Mike was \"moving on to new opportunities.\"\n\nI left at 5:00 PM sharp that day.",
