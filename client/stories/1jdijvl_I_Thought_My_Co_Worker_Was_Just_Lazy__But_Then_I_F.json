  "description": "So, there’s this guy at work, Mike. You know the type—always the last one to respond in group chats, takes forever to finish assignments, and somehow manages to disappear right when things get busy. Everyone in the office kind of rolls their eyes when his name comes up.\n\nI’ll be honest, I thought he was just slacking off. Like, how hard is it to meet a deadline or answer an email? It was frustrating because the rest of us had to pick up the slack.\n\nThen, last week, I had to cover for him while he was out. That’s when I found an email thread between him and our boss—turns out, Mike has been dealing with some pretty serious health issues. He didn’t talk about it, didn’t ask for special treatment, just quietly did what he could while handling a situation way bigger than work.\n\nIt hit me like a ton of bricks. Here I was assuming the worst about him, when in reality, he was doing his best under tough circumstances.\n\nWhen he came back, I made sure to check in and offer to help whenever he needed it. He just smiled and said, “I appreciate it, man. I just don’t want to be a burden.”\n\nMoral of the story: You never really know what someone’s dealing with behind the scenes. Maybe give people a little more grace.\n\nWhat do you think? Has this ever happened to you?",
