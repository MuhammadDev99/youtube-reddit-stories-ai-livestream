  "description": "So, a couple months ago I matched with this girl on Tinder. We had a pretty normal convo, nothing crazy, but eventually she asks me to grab coffee. Chill, right? We meet at this cute local spot, she gives me a quick hug, and right off the bat she says:\n\n“Wow, you look even better than your hiking pics!”\n\nProblem is… I don’t hike. Like, I don’t even walk briskly. I just nod and laugh it off.\n\nWe keep talking and she starts referencing stuff that makes zero sense. “Your dog is so cute—what was his name again? Bentley?” I don’t have a dog. Never have. Then she mentions how I told her I used to live in Colorado. Again, not me. I’ve never even been west of Kansas.\n\nSo now I’m trying to figure out if I have early onset memory loss or if she’s mistaking me for someone else entirely.\n\nFinally, mid-latte, I ask, “Hey, just to clarify… what’s my name?”\n\nShe looks confused. “Jake?”\n\nFriends… my name is not Jake.\n\nWe just stared at each other for a solid five seconds before she burst out laughing. Apparently, she was messaging two guys at once and mixed us up. The worst part? She said, “Honestly, I thought you were Jake this whole time but I was vibing too hard to stop.”\n\nWe ended up finishing the coffee, laughing about it, and weirdly enough… we’re still dating. She now has me in her phone as “Not Jake.”",
