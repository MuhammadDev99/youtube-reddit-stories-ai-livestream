  "title": "Pregnant ex gf cheated on me",
  "description": "She (F36) left me (M37) in June because I had sent a joke text to someone asking them for their ‘$100 pussy’ (inside joke from years ago) and said it was cheating. I thought for a while and I did agree it was cheating, I apologized and said it meant no harm and if the roles were reversed I would be upset but not leave them. She left 2 days later. \n\nShe called me last night (4-Oct) and told me she’s 28 weeks pregnant, and the baby is her exes. We talked for a good 20 minutes before it clicked in my head that we were together at that timeframe - I said ‘wait, why did you call me to say you cheated on me?’ She said ‘I didn’t’, I said ‘please do some first grade math’, and hung up. I woke up to a text saying ‘I’m sorry I’m a piece of shit’. \n\nHaven’t been cheated on in 2 decades and I’m sitting at a bar beside myself. How is your Saturday going?\n\nE: thanks for all your concerns. I loved this woman for so long it’s just hard for me to move on - I will. It’s just hard. \n\nE2: I am in decent shape, I go to the gym regularly. I am financially stable and do not struggle with money. Thanks for the concern? Some of your comments are vile.",
