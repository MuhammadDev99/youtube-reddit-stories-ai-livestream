  "description": "A few weeks ago, I shared how my boss completely stole credit for a major project I had spent months working on. I didn’t say anything at first, but when he presented my work to upper management as his own without even acknowledging my contributions, I was furious.\n\nI decided right then that I was done. I started quietly looking for new opportunities, and within two weeks, I had an offer—better pay, better title, and fully remote. I turned in my resignation, and let’s just say, my boss did not take it well.\n\nFirst, he acted indifferent, like he didn’t care. Then, two days before my last day, HR and upper management suddenly wanted to “discuss my future at the company.” I politely declined. That’s when the real desperation kicked in.\n\nMy boss, the same guy who had stolen my work, personally pulled me aside and tried to convince me to stay. He claimed I was \"an invaluable member of the team\" and that he \"always saw leadership potential\" in me. I asked him why, if that was the case, he had taken full credit for my project. He had no real answer—just mumbled something about \"teamwork.\"\n\nI left on good terms with my colleagues, but I made sure to let upper management know why I was leaving.\n\nNow, a week into my new job, I got an email from HR at my old company saying they’d be “open to negotiating a counteroffer” if I reconsidered. Absolutely not. I love my new job, my manager actually respects me, and I get to work in my pajamas. No regrets.\n\nFor anyone stuck in a toxic work environment—know your worth.",
