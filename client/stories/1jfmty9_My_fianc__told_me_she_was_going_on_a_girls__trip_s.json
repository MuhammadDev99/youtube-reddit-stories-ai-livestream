  "description": "If you only read the title, I might sound like a controlling jerk. But I promise you, I’m not.\n\nI’ve been with my fiancée, Rachel, for three years. We got engaged six months ago, and everything seemed perfect—until I started noticing little things. Sudden late-night meetings, a new password on her phone, and the biggest red flag: a “girls’ trip” she was oddly secretive about.\n\nI wasn’t the jealous type, but something didn’t sit right. So, I did something I never thought I’d do—I checked our shared airline account. Turns out, her “girls' trip” was actually a solo ticket to a tropical resort… booked under her name and another man’s. I recognized his name. A “friend” from work.\n\nI didn’t confront her right away. Instead, I got to planning. I quietly canceled her ticket and rebooked it… to her parents' house. Same departure time, just a very different destination. I also compiled all the evidence—screenshots, texts I found on her old tablet, and even a few Venmo transactions that made things obvious.\n\nThe day of the trip arrived. I drove her to the airport, kissed her goodbye, and watched as she confidently walked inside. I had one of my friends tail her to see the moment she realized she wasn’t heading to paradise with her affair partner.\n\nHer first call came 20 minutes later. I ignored it. The frantic texts followed:\n\nRachel: “Why is my ticket wrong??”\nRachel: “Where are my bags??”\nRachel: “DID YOU DO THIS???”\n\nI didn’t reply. Instead, I group-texted her, her parents, and her older brother with a simple message:\n\n“Hey, Rachel’s on her way to see you. She has something important to explain. Check your emails for the full story. Hope she has a great stay.”\n\nThen, I blocked her number.\n\nI don’t know how things went when she landed, but judging by the hundred missed calls from her and a few from her mom… I’d say it wasn’t pretty. Meanwhile, I changed the locks, packed up her things, and had them delivered to her parents' place.\n\nI spent that weekend with my best friends, having the celebratory drinks I didn’t know I needed.\n\nSo yeah, Rachel did go on a trip—just not the one she planned.",
