    "description": "me and my girlfriend,(both 26) have been dating for three years now. my girlfriend is a huge Taylor swift fan and was really excited when she found out taylor would be performing at met life stadium, right near us. I decided to surprise her with taylor swift concert tickets, since i knew she really wanted to go. I called in sick the day the tickets dropped and waited in the ticket master cue for 2 hours. finally when it opened up, i bought two seats, for 400 dollars each, presumably one for her, and another for me. When she came back from work that night i surprised her with the tickets, and she was ecstatic. However, when I claimed i was excited to go with her, she got very confused and claimed she thought the two tickets were for her and her best friend, (who is also a big Taylor swift fan). I was very disappointed since I believed that this was an experience we could do together and it would be something we would remember for the rest of our lives. My girlfriend could tell I was upset and said she would be happy to go with me instead. I told her she should go with whoever she wanted to go with more, and to not go with me just because it was what i had planned. After hearing this my girlfriend immediately called her friend and told her that they were going to the taylor swift concert together (ouch). I told my girlfriend that if her friend wanted to go with her she had to pay the 400 dollars for the ticket and her friend agreed to. While my girlfriend and her friend went together and both had a great time I felt betrayed since she chose her over me. While i know my girlfriend’s bff is a much bigger taylor swift fan than me, i was still excited to go since i’ve never been to a concert before, and i like to listen to some of taylor swifts songs. Like i said before i also believed this would be a memory we could both remember together. Should I have done things differently and not given up my ticket so willingly?",

  "content": "Man: I just... I can't believe she actually called her friend right in front of me.\n\nWoman: Wait, what? Called her about what? What happened?\n\nMan: The Taylor Swift tickets. I surprised her with them last night—two tickets, four hundred bucks each. I waited in that damn Ticketmaster queue for two hours, called in sick to work for this.\n\nWoman: Oh my god, that’s so sweet! She must have freaked out.\n\nMan: She did! She was screaming, jumping up and down... and then I said, \"I can’t wait to go with you,\" and she just... stopped. Got this confused look on her face.\n\nWoman: What do you mean \"confused\"? Didn’t she realize you bought them for the two of you?\n\nMan: Apparently not! She said she thought the second ticket was for her best friend. Like, why would I buy a ticket for her friend? I’ve never done that before.\n\nWoman: Are you serious? So what did you say?\n\nMan: I told her I was really disappointed, that I thought it would be this big thing for us—a memory, you know? And she could tell I was hurt, so she backtracked and said, \"Okay, I’ll go with you.\"\n\nWoman: Okay, so she tried to fix it. That’s something.\n\nMan: Yeah, but then I—like an idiot—said, \"No, go with whoever you want to go with more.\" I didn’t want her to go with me just ’cause she felt guilty.\n\nWoman: Oh no. You shouldn’t have said that.\n\nMan: I know! The second the words were out of my mouth, she picked up her phone, called her friend, and was like, \"We’re going to Taylor!\" I was standing right there.\n\nWoman: No. She did not do that right in front of you.\n\nMan: She did. And then I told her if her friend wants to go, she has to pay me for the ticket. Which she did, but... it just felt so shitty. She chose her over me without even hesitating.\n\nWoman: But you literally told her to go with her friend! You gave her an out.\n\nMan: I know, but I guess I hoped she’d want to choose me? I’ve never been to a concert before—any concert—and I like Taylor’s music too. I really thought this would be our thing.\n\nWoman: I get why you’re hurt. It’s not about the concert; it’s that she didn’t even consider you.\n\nMan: Exactly. They had a great time, too. She sent me videos all night. And I’m happy for her, but... damn. It just stings.\n\nWoman: So what are you gonna do?\n\nMan: I don’t know. I love her, but now I’m wondering if I should’ve just stood my ground. Maybe I gave up too easily.",
