    "description": "Hi there, yes I did go to the police. Before I did I decided to look through the camera feed to see if there had been any more occasions of him hitting her. It had happened once before. We have one of the ones where we can access it from our phones, incase anyone is confused. I did as some of you said and took pictures of her bruises.\n\nI did take the footage to the police. His mother found out and called me enraged, saying how could I ruin a good man's life. I simply hung up on her and blocked her. Legal shit is going on, and when I was checking the camera I saw he'd done exactly as I thought he would. He ended up destroying some of the stuff I left behind, such as my grandmother's China collection she left behind, some pictures of me and my family, my favorite dress, and some stuff I had been collecting so we could get a dog. So I'm taking that to the police as well.\n\nSorry this isn't a big update it's only been like a week. I might update when this is all over.",

But before I did, I went through the camera feed on my phone—you know, that security system we have? I had to see if there were more times he'd hit her.\n\nMan: Oh god. Were there?\n\nWoman: Yeah, it happened once before, too. And I took pictures of the bruises, like people told me to. I felt so sick doing it, but I had to.\n\nMan: I’m so sorry. What did the police say when you showed them?\n\nWoman: They took it seriously, thank god. But then his mother found out and called me, absolutely screaming. She said, \"How could you ruin a good man’s life?\"\n\nMan: Are you kidding me? After what he did? That’s insane.\n\nWoman: I just hung up on her. Blocked her number right after. I couldn’t even engage.\n\nMan: Good. You don’t need that. But wait—you said you checked the camera again? Did something else happen?\n\nWoman: Yeah, he went back to the house. He destroyed so much of my stuff. My grandma’s China collection she left me, family pictures, my favorite dress… even the things I’d been collecting for us to get a dog someday. All of it.\n\nMan: He did that? After hitting your daughter? What kind of \"good man\" does that?\n\nWoman: I know. It just confirmed everything. I’m taking that footage to the police, too. It’s all evidence now.\n\nMan: You’re doing the right thing. This is a lot to handle in just a week.\n\nWoman: I know it’s not a huge update yet, but honestly? I feel… resolved. Like I’m protecting us now. No matter how messy it gets, I’m not backing down.",
