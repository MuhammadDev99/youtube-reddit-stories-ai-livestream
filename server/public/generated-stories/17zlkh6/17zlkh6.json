    "description": "Yes, yes, it sounds like a plot from an adult film. At the beginning of the year, my sink started leaking, and since I live in an apartment, my landlord scheduled an appointment with a plumber to fix it. I left work early, and it happened to be the first snowstorm of the year. I got completely stuck in the snow with my car in front of my place. The plumber was already there, working on plumbing at my neighbor's. Still stuck in the snow, my neighbor came to warn me that the plumber was waiting. I was frustrated with my car situation. I went inside, opened the door, and saw this incredibly handsome guy. I was momentarily speechless. After finally managing to free my car from the snow, I went inside. I'm quite introverted and shy in life, but I awkwardly tried to make conversation. We spoke strangely, as if we knew each other. When he finished, we said goodbye, and he left. Later, he returned and rang my doorbell. I thought he had probably forgotten something, but he asked for my phone number! I was so happy; we started texting, and on our first date, everything felt so natural. I felt comfortable with him like never before. Today, we're a couple, and he lives with me. I'm dating my plumber.",

Remember that huge snowstorm back in January?\n\nMan: Yeah, the one where everything shut down? You were texting me about your car getting stuck.\n\nWoman: Exactly! So I’m outside, totally buried in snow, and my neighbor comes out to tell me the plumber was already there, waiting for me. I was so frustrated and freezing.\n\nMan: And then you walked in and…?\n\nWoman: And there he was. This ridiculously handsome guy just standing in my hallway with his toolbox. I swear, I froze—and not just from the cold. I couldn’t even form a sentence.\n\nMan: No way. And you’re usually so quiet! What did you even say?\n\nWoman: I don’t even remember! Something awkward like, “Hi, sorry about the weather?” We started talking, and it was… strange. Like we already knew each other? The conversation just flowed, even though I’m usually terrible at small talk.\n\nMan: So he fixes the sink, leaves, and then…?\n\nWoman: He came back! Rang my doorbell like ten minutes later. I thought he forgot a tool or something. But he just… asked for my number. I was so shocked I almost dropped my phone.\n\nMan: And you said yes, obviously.\n\nWoman: Of course I did! We started texting that night. Our first date felt so natural—like I’d known him for years. I’ve never felt that comfortable with someone so quickly.\n\nMan: And now he’s moved in? That was fast!\n\nWoman: I know, it sounds insane. But it just… works. He’s the best thing that’s happened to me. Who knew a leaky sink would lead to this?\n\nMan: Honestly, I’m happy for you. It’s like a rom-com, but real.\n\nWoman: Thanks. I still pinch myself sometimes. My plumber. Who would’ve thought?",
