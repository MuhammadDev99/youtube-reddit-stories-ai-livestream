    "description": "Had a rough morning this morning. Dealing with depression. I'm in therapy for it and taking medication so I'm on the road to recovery but I still have tough days.  \n\n\nThis morning I had a break down. I was being really down on myself and had a lot of self disgust. But my son needed a wipe for his runny nose. So I went to get him one and accidentally spilled something on the way. It was the straw that broke the camels back. I collapsed on the floor and started sobbing.   \n\n\nNormally I try my best to do my crying out of my son's view. I don't want him to worry about his dad. I want to be a rock for him. Strong and stable. But in this moment I couldn't help it.   \n\n\nBut when my son noticed me crying I couldn't have been prouder. He came up to me and said \"why are you crying daddy\" and I said through my sobbing... \"I don't know....\"  \n\n\nHe gave me as big of a hug as his little arms could and he said \"It's okay daddy.\"   \n\n\nHe ran over to his wipes and brought them over to me and tried to dry my eyes. He asked me to blow my nose. I did. He grabbed the tissue from me and said \"It's okay I throw that away for you daddy.\"  \n\n\nI grabbed him and gave him the biggest squeeze. He said \"You better now?\" and I said \"I'm better now\"  \n\n\nI'm so lucky.\n\nEdit: thank you all for your support❤️❤️🤗🤗. I wasn't expecting all this attention so again thank you all and i will promise to be strong❤️❤️💪💪",

Did something go wrong with your meds or…?\n\nWoman: No, no, it’s not that. It’s just… you know how I’ve been dealing with depression. Some mornings it just hits harder.\n\nMan: I get it. Was it one of those days?\n\nWoman: Yeah. This morning, I was just… drowning in it. So much self-disgust, you know? And then my son needed a wipe for his nose, and on my way to get it, I spilled something—I don’t even remember what—and I just… collapsed. Started sobbing right there on the floor.\n\nMan: Oh, man. And your son was there?\n\nWoman: Yeah. I always try to hide it from him. I want to be strong for him, you know? His rock. But today I just couldn’t.\n\nMan: That’s gotta be hard. What did he do?\n\nWoman: He came over and he said, “Why are you crying, daddy?” And I could barely talk, but I told him, “I don’t know…”\n\nMan: Wow. And then?\n\nWoman: He gave me this huge hug—like, as big as his little arms could manage—and he said, “It’s okay, daddy.” Then he ran and got the wipes, brought them over, and tried to dry my eyes.\n\nMan: No way. He’s three!\n\nWoman: I know. And then he asked me to blow my nose. When I did, he took the tissue and said, “It’s okay, I throw that away for you, daddy.”\n\nMan: (softly) That’s… incredible.\n\nWoman: I grabbed him and squeezed him so tight. And he goes, “You better now?” And I told him, “Yeah, I’m better now.”\n\nMan: (pauses) You must be so proud of him.\n\nWoman: I am. More than I can even say. In the middle of all that darkness… he was my little light. I’m so lucky.\n\nMan: You really are. And you’re doing a great job, you know that? Being honest with him, letting him see you… that’s strength, too.\n\nWoman: (voice steadier, more resolved) Yeah. I’m gonna keep being strong—for him, and for me.",
