    "description": "My wife had got home from work late which wasn’t unusual for her since she usually had night shifts but last week she came back sweaty and was acting strange I decided to check her messages and that’s when I found it a string of messages between her and another man I confronted her about it and she began to cry saying how sorry she was but I just got her out the door ever since she has been texting me how sorry she was but I don’t think I can forgive her what should I do \n\n(A few hours after this post) I have decided after reading all the comments and advice that I’m going to divorce her I text her I’m going to divorce her and she just begged me not to but I decided I’m going through with it I just can’t forgive her that’s it for now anything more happens I’ll update on this Post thank you for all the support and comments it means a lot.",

She came home all sweaty and acting weird, and when I confronted her she just started crying.\n\nWoman: Wait, she came home sweaty? From work? I thought she had night shifts at the hospital.\n\nMan: That's what she always said. But this was different. She was panicked, trying to hug me but I pushed her away. I told her to get out.\n\nWoman: Oh my god. And she's been texting you since?\n\nMan: Nonstop. \"I'm so sorry, it was a mistake, I'll do anything.\" But how do you come back from that? How do you trust someone again after they...\n\nWoman: So what are you going to do? Have you talked to a lawyer or anything?\n\nMan: Actually... I texted her a few hours ago. Told her I'm filing for divorce.\n\nWoman: *gasps* Seriously? And?\n\nMan: She begged. Said we could \"reset\" everything. But I just... I can't. I kept reading all these comments from people who went through the same thing, and they all said once that trust is broken...\n\nWoman: Do you think you'll ever be able to forgive her?\n\nMan: Maybe someday. But not today. Not ever enough to take her back. I just feel... numb. But resolved, you know? It's over.",
