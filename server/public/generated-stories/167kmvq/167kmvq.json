    "title": "A woman helped me when I was homeless and I'll never forget her.",
    "description": "When I was younger, I was homeless. I had been emancipated from my family and had a lot of trauma from being raped at age 15 along with other abuse throughout my childhood. I ended up getting into drugs, and then decided the only way to get sober was to hitchhike around the state so I could never make connections.\n\nI was young, naive, scared, traumatized, and alone. One thing you learn very quickly when you're homeless is that people treat you as sub-human. I got my first criminal charge at age 18 for sleeping in a public park. They woke me up and told me to leave in the middle of the night, I had nowhere else to go. People avert their eyes when you walk by. You aren't allowed to use the bathroom anywhere, even if someone else looking less homeless would have been allowed. People shout things at you and talk down to you. It's pretty demoralizing. \n\nOne day, I was sitting on the sidewalk and holding a sign that I think just said \"hungry\". (I didn't have a lot of skills and couldn't maintain a job because of moving around. I was also afraid to have more than a few dollars at a time because my sobriety was still fresh. I realize now the issues with begging, and would never do it again.)\n\nAnyways, this woman walks by me with two young daughters and looks at my sign. She looks at me and says, \"You're hungry?! Well why don't you come eat with us?\" Keep in mind, I'm used to people shielding their children from me. Children would walk by me and ask their parents questions and the parents would shush them and rush them along. I was taboo. Not to be acknowledged. \n\nSo already this was astounding to me. She is letting me eat a meal with her and her children? She takes me into the restaurant and we all sit down. She asks me about my life and why I'm on the streets. She asks me about myself. She seems genuinely interested and not afraid. This is the first time I've been treated like a human in a long time. She gets me breakfast and even a dessert, which I try to refuse. \n\nAfter that, she gave me money and her phone number on a piece of paper. She said to call if I ever needed anything. Her name was Dawn.\n\n\nI will never forget her. Dawn, if you're out there, you reminded me that day that I was still human. That I deserved kindness and respect. That I wasn't some broken, scary monster. Thank you. I will never forget that. \n\nIf I still had her number I would call in a heartbeat, but it was lost when my backpack was stolen a few months later. \n\nAlso, in case anyone cares, I have been sober for six years now and I'm housed and working. Almost done with my associates degree.\n\nEdit: A few people have asked how I got housed, so I'll put it here. Social programs, funded by the federal, state, and local government. That's literally it. I went to a rehab paid for by Medicaid, a transitional housing program funded by my county and the federal Housing Authority, and I'm still using my Section 8 Housing voucher funded by the federal government (although I'm working in IT now so I hope to be completely self-sufficient soon ;) ) Fund social programs! They work!",

I was just thinking about this woman, Dawn. Her name was Dawn.\n\nMan: Dawn? Who’s that?\n\nWoman: Someone I met years ago, back when I was…you know, on the streets. Hitchhiking.\n\nMan: Oh. That time. Yeah. You don’t talk about that much.\n\nWoman: I know. It’s just…hard. But I was sitting there one day, holding this stupid sign that just said “hungry.” And I was so used to people just…looking through me. Pretending I wasn’t even there.\n\nMan: God, that’s…I can’t even imagine.\n\nWoman: Parents would literally pull their kids away from me. Like I was some monster. And then…this woman, Dawn, she walks by with her two little girls. And she stops. She looks at my sign and she says, “You’re hungry?! Well why don’t you come eat with us?”\n\nMan: Wait, seriously? She invited you to eat with her and her kids? Just like that?\n\nWoman: Yeah. I was…stunned. I mean, absolutely floored. She took me into this restaurant, sat me down with them. Asked me about my life. Actually talked to me like I was a person.\n\nMan: That’s…incredible. Most people would’ve just given you a dollar and kept walking.\n\nWoman: She got me breakfast. And dessert, which I tried to refuse, but she insisted. And then…after, she gave me some money and her phone number on a piece of paper. Told me to call if I ever needed anything.\n\nMan: Did you? Call her, I mean.\n\nWoman: I lost the number. My backpack got stolen a few months later. It was in there. But…I’ve never forgotten her. She looked at me and saw a person. Not some broken thing. She was the first one in so long who did that.\n\nMan: That’s…that’s really powerful. I’m sorry you went through all that, but…I’m glad someone showed you that kindness.\n\nWoman: Me too. Sometimes, that’s all it takes, you know? One person treating you like you matter. It…it reminds you that you do.\n\nMan: And look at you now. Sober. Housed. Working. Almost done with your degree.\n\nWoman: Yeah. I made it. And part of me…a big part…owes that to Dawn. For showing me I was still worth something. I just…I hope she knows that. Wherever she is.",
