    "description": "WARNING! don't read this if you have any problems with feces and that kind of shit (pun intended) \nSomeone told me that I should share this embarrassing story so here we go. (Disclaimer, English isn't my first language, so I'm sorry for all the spelling/grammar mistakes)\n\nMe [F18] had just gotten in a relationship with my new sweet boyfriend [M20]. \nA little info about me. I have a chronic stomach wound which pops up whenever I'm really stressed. \n\nThe relationship was very new so we were both still quite shy, we had just gotten comfortable enough farting in front of each other tho, and often made a joke out of it. \nAbout a month into our relationship I had to go to the hospital with my stomach wound, I was there for a week and he was super supportive the whole time. \nWhen I finally got home from the hospital my body was so weak, I wasn't allowed to drink or eat anything the whole week because of the tests they had to make. Therefore my body had pretty much shut down, nothing had come in, so nothing came out. I got prescribed some laxatives that I took, never having taken them before I didn't know what to expect but it definitely wasn't this! \nWe were laying in bed, I was on my side looking at my phone, and he was half sitting up in bed playing RuneScape on his laptop in front of me. I could feel a fart coming, so I looked up into his eyes with a smirk face expression and said: \"I'm shitting!\" \n\nI meant to say \"I'm farting\" but the words came out wrong.. and so did something else. The moment I said it, I let it all out, still with a smirk face expression looking him right in the eyes. You could hear a wet bubbly sound, and I instantly knew what had happened. My smile fated and my face turned to horror, my hand flew down to stop the flow but it was too late. Boyfriend jumped up and ran to the toilet to bring me paper, he helped me clean up while just laughing hysterically, I was so embarrassed that I couldn't even say anything. \n\nLater when we sat and talked he told me that it was the most intimidating thing he had ever experienced, the way I looked right into his eyes, he had never felt so dominated in his life. \"Like a monkey shitting in its hand and throwing it\". \nNeedless to say we got very quickly comfortable with intimate things like that after this. \nEven tho we've broken up since then and it's been a few years, I'm to this day still just as embarrassed.",

You said it was about your ex and something...embarrassing?\n\nWoman: [Deep sigh] God, I still get hot just thinking about it. So you know how I had that stomach condition, right? The one that flares up when I'm stressed?\n\nMan: Yeah, the chronic wound thing. You were in the hospital right after you started dating that guy, right? What was his name—Mark?\n\nWoman: Yeah, Mark. So I'd just gotten home after a week in the hospital. They had me on no food or drinks because of tests, so my system was completely...backed up. The doctor prescribed laxatives, and I'd never taken them before.\n\nMan: Oh no. Where is this going? Wait—were you guys at his place?\n\nWoman: We were in bed! I was lying on my side looking at my phone, and he was half-sitting up playing RuneScape on his laptop. And I felt...you know, a fart coming. So I looked right into his eyes with this smirk and said, \"I'm shitting!\"\n\nMan: You said shitting?! You meant farting, right? Please tell me you meant farting.\n\nWoman: I MEANT to say farting! But the words came out wrong and so did—everything else. There was this wet, bubbly sound and I just froze. My hand flew down to try to stop it but it was too late.\n\nMan: No. No way. And he was right there? What did he do?!\n\nWoman: He jumped up and ran to get toilet paper! He was laughing hysterically while helping me clean up. I was so mortified I couldn't even speak.\n\nMan: But he was cool about it? He didn't freak out?\n\nWoman: Later he told me it was the most intimidating thing he'd ever experienced. He said I looked him right in the eyes like I was dominating him or something. He compared it to—get this—\"a monkey shitting in its hand and throwing it.\"\n\nMan: [Bursts out laughing] He did NOT say that! That's actually kind of amazing.\n\nWoman: I know! And honestly, after that, we got super comfortable with all the gross intimate stuff really fast. But even though we broke up years ago, I still get that same wave of embarrassment whenever I think about it. I mean, I literally shit the bed while maintaining eye contact.\n\nMan: Wow. Just...wow. I don't think I'd ever recover.\n\nWoman: I haven't. I'm pretty sure that memory will haunt me on my deathbed.",
