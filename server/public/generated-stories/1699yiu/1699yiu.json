    "description": "My SIL is…. not smart to put it kindly. She has done some very idiotic things during the course of my husband and my relationship but this takes the freaking cake. SIL is incredibly gullible and believes literally anything she reads on the internet. Well she read that if you give yourself an enema with coffee it can help cleanse toxins from your body (cue collective eye roll).\nBIL comes home one day to a scary looking mess in the bathroom; what appears to be blood soaked pads, towels, etc. BIL freaks out and immediately begins asking SIL what happened and if she’s okay. SIL gets very cagey and avoidant of his questions. BIL continues panicking thinking something is incredibly wrong and SIL needs to go to the ER. Finally, BIL gets her to spill. \nAfter reading on the internet that it is healthy and beneficial to give yourself and enema with coffee she decided to try it! Only she missed one very important step in letting your coffee cool down first before you try to insert it into your asshole. So SIL gave herself and unsuccessful enema with hot coffee and literally burned her rectum. She refused to go to the doctor out of embarrassment. This is my favorite story that I have ever had the pleasure of hearing in my life and now it gets to grace Reddit as well\n\n***edited to add BIL in this post is SILs husband, sorry for the confusion I should have written that part better. SIL reluctantly relayed this story to my husband (her brother) at great urging from her husband\n\nEdit: this happened months ago and as far as I know SIL has not suffered any side effects from this. We are no longer on speaking terms due to how she decided to treat my husband, my mother in law (her mother), and myself. It was not actually blood on the towels and pads but a coffee/poo mixture.",

What did she do this time?\n\nWoman: Okay, so you know how she’s always falling for those weird health trends? She read online that giving yourself a coffee enema “cleanses toxins.”\n\nMan: *laughs* No way. Please tell me she didn’t—\n\nWoman: She did! But here’s the worst part—BIL came home to what looked like a crime scene in their bathroom. Towels, pads, everything just… covered in what he thought was blood.\n\nMan: Oh shit, was she okay? Did he call an ambulance?\n\nWoman: That’s what he thought too! He was panicking, begging her to tell him what happened, if she needed to go to the ER. And she just kept dodging his questions.\n\nMan: So what was it? Was she bleeding?\n\nWoman: No! *laughs* She finally admitted she tried to give herself a coffee enema—but she used it boiling hot.\n\nMan: *bursts out laughing* She didn’t—\n\nWoman: She burned her rectum! She literally poured hot coffee into her ass and gave herself a burn!\n\nMan: No. No way. That’s… I can’t even. Did she go to the doctor?\n\nWoman: Nope, too embarrassed. She refused. And get this—the “blood” was just coffee mixed with… well, you know.\n\nMan: I’m honestly speechless. That might be the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.\n\nWoman: Right? And honestly, as much as I’m laughing, it’s just the perfect example of why we’re not speaking anymore. She’s just… next-level.\n\nMan: Yeah, no kidding. What a mess.\n\nWoman: Honestly, I’m just glad it’s a story I get to keep forever. Some people just live in their own world.",
