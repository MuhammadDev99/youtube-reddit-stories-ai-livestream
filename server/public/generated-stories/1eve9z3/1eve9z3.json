    "description": "It sounds unbelievable, but that’s exactly what happened. Just before the interview, I felt an urgent need to use the bathroom but hoped I could hold it for the 10 minutes before the interview. I was mistaken. I had a severe stomach issue and ended up having a bowel movement right before the interview. I cleaned myself up quickly and joined the call, but I was still dealing with the aftermath.\n\nDuring the interview with the COO, I could hear my stomach making loud noises, and I was sweating from the discomfort. I hoped it would end quickly, but the COO kept asking questions. Eventually, I couldn’t hold it any longer and soiled myself during the interview.\n\nDespite the unfortunate situation, the COO said I was a great fit for the position and offered me a job with a three times higher salary than my previous one, along with excellent benefits. I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at that point. I ended the call, had to replace my chair, and will likely share this story with my grandchildren in the future. It was a terrible experience but ended with an incredible outcome.",

I shit my pants. During my job interview.\n\nWoman: Wait—what? Are you serious? During the actual interview?\n\nMan: Yes. I felt it coming right before the call, but I thought I could hold it for ten minutes. I was so wrong. My stomach was just… not okay.\n\nWoman: Oh no. So what did you do?\n\nMan: I tried to clean up fast and joined the call anyway. But I was sweating, my stomach was making these awful noises… and the COO just kept asking questions.\n\nWoman: You’re kidding. He didn’t notice anything?\n\nMan: I don’t know, maybe he did. But then… in the middle of answering something about my experience, it happened again. I couldn’t stop it.\n\nWoman: Oh my god. I can’t even imagine. What did you do?\n\nMan: I just kept going. I was mortified. But then—get this—at the end, he said I was a great fit and offered me the job. Tripled my salary. Amazing benefits.\n\nWoman: Wait, seriously? He offered you the job *after* that?\n\nMan: Yeah. I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. I ended the call, threw my chair away, and just sat there in shock.\n\nWoman: That’s… honestly, that’s kind of amazing. Horrifying, but amazing.\n\nMan: I know. Worst moment of my life, but maybe the best outcome. I’m still cringing, but… I got the job.\n\nWoman: You’re gonna be telling your grandkids this story someday.\n\nMan: Yeah. For now, I’m just trying to laugh about it. And buy a new chair.",
