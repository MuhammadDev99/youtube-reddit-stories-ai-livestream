    "title": "My mother slept with my boyfriend.",
    "description": "I (26f) have been dating (30m) for 7 months. Let's call him Devin. I took Devin with me to my family reunion this year. It was held at a group of cabins at a lake in Northern Georgia. We have family spread out across the US and every 2 years we pick a location and congregate for the weekend. I did not expect to walk in on THIS kind or congregation though. \nDevin had met my mother (47 f) once before, at dinner, along with my brother and sister that are both a few years younger than me. Our parents divorced several years ago and my father is busy drinking himself dead with his new girlfriend so he did not attend dinner or the reunion. \nI did not pick up on any weird vibes or stolen glances at dinner, and mother and I have some boundaries already about dating. She and I are only 21 years apart, both fit and attractive. I like guys older than me and she likes guys younger than her. Mother currently has a boyfriend, Frank (41m). They've been together for about 1.5 years. Frank did not attend the family reunion. \n\nSo during the reunion, Devin has been distant from me. He found literally anything else to do than have a connection with me all weekend. Before the big meal on Saturday, he told me he didn't find me very attractive. He said I'm too tall, not fit enough, he doesn't like that I have a child (3m), and I smoke too much weed. \nI know he's grasping at straws. I am a tall woman at 5'11\". But I only weigh 150lbs and I don't work out excessively but I am strong. \nMy son is really cool, and I have to baby daddy to have drama with. Devin should've said something about that a long time ago, right? \nAnd for the weed, I only smoke on special occasions. \n\nAnyway we had a talk and it turned into an argument and Devin stormed out. \nWe were staying in a room in one of the cabins. He stormed out and, apparently, into the RV where my mother was staying. \n\nI cried a lot and finally composed myself to go talk with my mom like girls do in a breakup right? I opened the RV door and took one step up. I look to my left where I see them both sprawled out on the bed, breathing heavy and freshly orgasmed. They see me and do the \"oh shit\" jump and cover. I said nothing. Just walked over and slapped my mother across the face and walked back out. \n\nWalking back towards the cabin I see cars arriving with more family members and food to prepare for the final family day feast. \n\nI have no idea what I'm supposed to do now. Do I tell my family? Do I tell her boyfriend? Do I act like nothing happened until after the party? How can I ever trust my mother again? How can I rebuild my self esteem after a hit like that? \n\nTldr: My mother slept with my boyfriend during a family reunion.",

  "content": "Man: Wait, slow down. You walked in on them... in the RV? Both of them?\n\nWoman: Yeah. Just... sprawled out. Breathing heavy. They’d obviously just finished. They saw me and jumped like “oh shit” and tried to cover up.\n\nMan: Oh my god. And you just... slapped her?\n\nWoman: Yeah. I didn’t say a word. Just walked over, smacked her across the face, and walked out. My hand was shaking.\n\nMan: I don’t blame you. Jesus. But hold on—before that, he said all that crap? That you’re not attractive? That he doesn’t like that you have a kid?\n\nWoman: Yeah. Out of nowhere. Said I’m too tall—which he knew from day one—not fit enough, that my son was a problem... and that I smoke too much weed.\n\nMan: But you barely smoke! And he knew about your son for seven months. Why wait until a family reunion to drop that bomb? That doesn’t make sense.\n\nWoman: I know! He was just looking for an excuse. He stormed out after we argued and went straight to her. I think he was just trying to pick a fight so he could leave and... do that.\n\nMan: And your mom... she’s 47. She has a boyfriend! Frank wasn’t there?\n\nWoman: No, he didn’t come. And her and I are only 21 years apart. We’ve even talked about boundaries with dating before. I never thought... I mean, my own mother.\n\nMan: So what are you gonna do? There’s still family everywhere, right? Are you gonna say something?\n\nWoman: I don’t know. I just walked back and saw cars pulling up with more food and cousins... everyone’s happy, setting up for the feast. How am I supposed to sit there and act normal? How do I ever look at her again?\n\nMan: You shouldn’t have to. This is on her. Not you.\n\nWoman: I know... but it feels like it. He looked at me and told me I wasn’t enough, and then he goes and sleeps with my mom. What does that say about me?\n\nMan: It says he’s a piece of shit and she’s even worse. You didn’t do anything wrong.\n\nWoman: *sighs* I just feel... hollow. And so angry. I don’t know if I’ll ever trust anyone again after this.",
