    "title": "GF (26F) had an affair with her boss but wants to stay together.",
    "description": "I (28M) have been with my girlfriend (26F) for 3 years, and we've been living together for almost the entire time. Two months ago, she received a job offer that would essentially require us to move further away from my job and my brother. I asked her not to accept the job, but she thought it would be good for her career, so I eventually conceded and agreed to move with her.\n\nShe informed her current job that she was leaving, and during that week, she came to me and said she wasn't sure if things would work out between us because I had been so unsupportive. She mentioned she was unhappy and that I didn't make her feel special. This news really shook me because I always envisioned a future with her. The thought of losing her over something seemingly trivial motivated me to take action.\n\nI immediately booked a fancy hotel room for us and took her out to show her how much I loved her. She agreed that we could take it day by day, so I did everything possible to make her believe in us again. I woke up early to cook breakfast, sent her sweet messages, and did everything I could think of to make her feel special.\n\nLater that week, I overheard her laughing on the phone with her boss, which gave me a weird feeling. I had always felt uncomfortable with how unprofessional she seemed with him, especially since they would hang out outside of work (in groups with coworkers). That night, while she was sleeping, I decided to check her phone—not expecting to find anything but just to be sure. However, the texts I found between her and her boss were extremely suggestive. I woke her up and confronted her. She admitted that he had confessed his feelings for her and that she might have feelings for him. She said he had kissed her once when she told him she was leaving the company, but nothing had happened since. She also told me that he had been trying to convince her to leave me.\n\nWe stayed up all night talking, and I told her that I could move on if she recommitted to our relationship and cut off all contact with him. The next day was her last day at her old job, and she told me she had the conversation with him and blocked him. The next six weeks were incredibly difficult for me, but I eventually started to feel better. However, there were a few inconsistencies in her story that bothered me.\n\nI wanted to move forward, get engaged, and recommit, but I needed to know the whole truth. So, I reached out to her boss. He told me that they had kissed three times, not just once, and the last time they kissed was when she told him she was going to try to reconcile with me (on her last day of work, after I found out). He also mentioned that they had talked a little the following week after she claimed she had blocked him and promised me she would never lie again.\n\nNow, I don't know what to do. I kicked her out of our apartment and said we couldn't live together anymore, but she keeps telling me she'll do anything to make it work between us. I told her I needed two weeks before we could talk again, but I don't know if I can ever get over this. Did she choose him over me? Was I the second option? What would have happened if I never found out? I don't know if I should move on or try to make it work. I still love her, and we have so much history together. We've gone on family vacations, and I had planned to propose within a few months. I'm so confused and feel alone. Are all women like this? Is there any chance of rebuilding trust?",

  "content": "Man: I just... I can't believe she actually lied to my face again. After everything.\n\nWoman: Wait, slow down. Start from the beginning. You reached out to her boss?\n\nMan: Yeah, I had to. Something wasn't sitting right with me. She told me they kissed once. Once. That's what she swore to me.\n\nWoman: And?\n\nMan: He said three times. Three. And the last time was after I found out—after she promised me she'd cut him off. On her last day of work, she kissed him again while telling him she was going to \"try\" with me.\n\nWoman: No way. After she looked you in the eye and promised? And she talked to him after she supposedly blocked him?\n\nMan: Yeah. The week after. She told me she never lied again, but she did. She absolutely did.\n\nWoman: I'm so sorry. That's... I don't even have words. So what did you do?\n\nMan: I kicked her out. Told her we can't live together right now. I just... I needed space. I told her we wouldn't talk for two weeks.\n\nWoman: And how's she taking it?\n\nMan: She's begging. Says she'll do anything to make it work. But... I keep wondering, if I never looked at her phone that night, what would've happened? Was I her backup plan? Did she actually choose him over me?\n\nWoman: You can't think like that. You know what you know now. And she didn't just lie once; she kept lying.\n\nMan: I know, but... we had plans. I was going to propose. We've done family trips, built a life. I love her. Or I loved who I thought she was.\n\nWoman: Do you think you could ever trust her again?\n\nMan: I don't know. I really don't. Every time I start to feel okay, I remember another detail—like how she told me I wasn't \"making her feel special\" right before I found out about the affair. Was that just to justify what she was doing?\n\nWoman: It sounds like she was rewriting history to make herself feel better about cheating.\n\nMan: Yeah. Yeah, it does. I feel so alone in this. And part of me wants to believe her when she says she'll change, but...\n\nWoman: But she had every chance to come clean and didn't. She only admitted to what you could prove.\n\nMan: Exactly. I think... I think I already know what I have to do. I just need to sit with it for these two weeks. Let myself really feel it instead of rushing back.\n\nWoman: That's smart. You deserve someone who chooses you first. Every time.\n\nMan: *sighs* I know. I just really thought she was that person.",
