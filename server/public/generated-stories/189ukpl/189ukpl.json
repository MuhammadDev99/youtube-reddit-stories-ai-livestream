    "description": "Okay, so this story is actually pretty tongue and cheek. I just thought it was hilarious. I 26m and my wife 28f have been together since high school. When we first started dating we took each others virginities when I was 16 and she was 18. We were both still and high school at the time. Honestly the whole relationship was pretty adorable right from the start. Holding hands on the bus, us getting off at the wrong bus stop so I could spend more time walking her home, us kissing on an old wooden bridge while it rained. Very hallmark type of stuff. As we grew older I would tease her that because I was 16 and she was technically an adult that means she technically groomed me (her being a 5'2 innocent catholic girl and me being a 5'9 lacrosse player). Her deflection for this was that the age of consent in our state is 16. But one night we were drinking and the same old joke came up. That led us to do some research on the actual law. Turns out yes the age of consent is 16 but the relationship has to at the approval of the younger parties parents. My wife then claimed that because my mom would buy my condoms for Christmas it was my mom's way of consenting to us having sex. Fast forward to this year. My mother was staying over at the house because she was on a business trip and didn't want to pay for any hotels. Once again I brought up the joke and my wife then used her Trump card about my mom buying condoms which means everything was cool. My mom then turned and looked at her and said, \"I didn't consent to you too having sex. I just bought my son condoms because I didn't want him getting any girls pregnant. I knew I couldn't stop him from having sex, but if he was going to I wanted him to use protection.\" I don't think I've laughed that hard in years. So now because of this revelation. I can now say the canonical story of events for me and my wife's long and very happy marriage starts with her grooming me as a young teen, technically molesting me, and then through her manipulating my young mind she convinced me to buy and ring and propose to her on the top of a mountain over looking a lake on a camping trip we went on together. Long story short, according to reddit logic. My wife is a pedophile and a child molester and I've sentenced her to asking for forgiveness over her large collection of Jesus candles (I told her not to be looking at the baby Jesus candle because I just know.) \n\nBefore the comments section starts freaking out. Yes I know there are real victims in this world and this story isn't ment to belittle their experience. I'm just trying to tell a wholesome and funny story that's finally come to a close.\n\nEdit- This post has made me realize that a lot of people either don't have a friendship with their significant other where there are recurring jokes or they aren't in a relationship with their best friend. They're in a relationship with their bully.",

  "content": "Man: You remember that running joke I have with Sarah, about her technically grooming me since she was 18 and I was 16 when we started dating?\n\nWoman: Oh my god, yes—the one where she always brings up the age of consent being 16 in your state. That bit always cracks me up.\n\nMan: Well, it just got so much better. My mom was staying over last week, and I brought it up again, you know, just teasing Sarah like usual.\n\nWoman: Wait, your mom was there? Oh, this is gonna be good. Did she actually say something?\n\nMan: Yeah! So Sarah pulls out her usual defense—the one about my mom buying me condoms for Christmas, saying that was her way of giving consent.\n\nWoman: Right, because your mom totally approved, right? That’s what Sarah always says.\n\nMan: Exactly. But this time, my mom just turns and looks Sarah dead in the eye and goes, \"I didn’t consent to you two having sex. I just bought my son condoms because I didn’t want him getting any girls pregnant.\"\n\nWoman: NO. She did not! Oh my god, your mom is a legend.\n\nMan: I know! She goes, \"I knew I couldn’t stop him from having sex, but if he was going to, I wanted him to use protection.\" I swear, I almost fell off the couch laughing.\n\nWoman: So wait, does that mean… technically, Sarah *did* groom you? Like, according to the law?\n\nMan: According to the *letter* of the law, yeah! Because the age of consent is 16 *only* if the parents approve—and my mom just publicly declared she never gave her blessing.\n\nWoman: Oh my god, so Sarah is officially a predator in your household’s lore now. That’s hilarious.\n\nMan: Right? So now I get to say our entire marriage is built on her grooming me, molesting me, and then manipulating me into proposing on that mountain overlooking the lake.\n\nWoman: And what does she say to that?\n\nMan: She just rolls her eyes and goes along with it. I told her she’s gotta ask for forgiveness over her collection of Jesus candles—especially the baby Jesus one. I’m like, \"Don’t even look at that one, I know what you’re thinking.\"\n\nWoman: You’re terrible. But honestly, it’s so you two. I love that after all these years, you’re still each other’s favorite person to mess with.\n\nMan: Yeah, I mean… it’s just us being us. It’s dumb and goofy, but it’s our thing. And honestly? I wouldn’t trade it for anything.",
