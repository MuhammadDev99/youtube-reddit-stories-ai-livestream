    "description": "When my daughter was 5 years old, and just starting kindergarten I would occasionally tell my daughter \"Just remember, no dating and no boyfriends until you turn 30 years old\".\n\nWishful thinking, I know.\n\nI told her this her first day of kindergarten, and she replied \"okay daddy\".\n\nThen I would tell her the same thing every once in a while.  Not too often to be annoying, but often enough that she knew my rule.\n\nThen one day, later in the school year (it may even have been when she was in 1st grade) as I was getting ready to drop her off at school, once again I said to her \"remember now, no dating and no boyfriends until you turn 30 years old\".\n\nThis time she had a totally different reply.\n\nShe turned to me, and looked right at me with those eyes that she could use to get whatever she wanted from her dad, and said \"Well, if I get good grades all through school and college, can I start dating when I am 29\"?\n\nIt took all the willpower I had to not smile and start laughing when she asked that. With a very serious look on my face, I showed her that I was taking a moment to consider what she had just asked.\n\nThen I replied to her \"Hmmm.....Well okay, you've got a deal. If you get good grades all through school and college I will let you start dating at 29\".\n\nShe replied, \"okay daddy\", got out of the car, and bounced her way on into school for the day.\n\nFor those who are going to ask, yes she waited till she was 29 to start dating, because she always followed daddy's rules.\n\nJust kidding.\n\nShe had her first boyfriend at around 13 years old, breaking her Daddy's heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

What happened?\n\nMan: You know how I used to always tell her, starting from kindergarten, \"No dating until you're thirty\"? Just this silly dad thing.\n\nWoman: Of course. Classic overprotective dad move. Wait, she actually listened to that?\n\nMan: At first, yeah! She'd just say \"Okay, Daddy\" and go about her day. But then one morning—I think she was in first grade by then—I drop the same line as I'm pulling up to school. And she turns to me with those big, serious eyes...\n\nWoman: Uh oh. She had a counteroffer, didn’t she?\n\nMan: Exactly! She goes, \"Well, if I get good grades all through school and college, can I start dating when I'm 29?\"\n\nWoman: No way! At six years old? That’s some serious negotiation skills. What did you do?\n\nMan: Man, I almost lost it. Had to force myself not to laugh. I put on my best serious face and pretended to really think about it.\n\nWoman: Of course you did. So what did you say?\n\nMan: I told her, \"Hmmm... well okay, you've got a deal.\" And she just said, \"Okay, Daddy,\" hopped out, and bounced into school like she’d won the lottery.\n\nWoman: That is adorable. So did she actually wait until 29?\n\nMan: *Laughs* Come on, you know how it goes. She had her first boyfriend at 13. Broke my heart a little.\n\nWoman: Aww. But you knew it was coming, right? You can’t actually stop them from growing up.\n\nMan: Yeah, I know. Still, part of me wishes that deal had stuck. She really had me convinced for a minute there.\n\nWoman: Kids, man. They know how to work us.\n\nMan: They really do. Honestly, though? I wouldn’t change a thing. Even the heartbreak.",
