    "description": "I never thought I’d be in this position, but here I am.. I'm consumed with guilt and honestly a little confusion. I’ve been seeing my therapist for about a year, and he specializes in eating disorders, which is something I've struggled with for a long time. Over time, our sessions became more personal and emotional.\n\nIt started with longer eye contact and his comforting touch on my shoulder. After one particularly intense session, he hugged me for a little too long. The line began to blur, and I started to develop feelings for him. One evening, after a deeply personal conversation about my progress and how I wish I had someone to celebrate with, he invited me to grab some drinks. I thought it was just him being kind and supportive, but in the back of my head I honestly hoped he'd confirm having similar feelings that I'd been having.\n\nWe sat closer than usual, at one point he even reached out to hold my hand. I could feel the tension between us. He complimented my progress and told me how proud he was of me. That's honestly what sent me even further into this intense feeling of lust. His words were soothing, and before I knew it, we were kissing. It felt surreal, like a dream. One thing led to another, and we ended up going back to his place and sleeping together. I know it was a huge ethical breach, and now I’m struggling with my emotions. I’m terrified of the consequences and that I now need to look for a different therapist. I'm never good at starting over.. idk what i'm going to do, I just needed to tell someone.",

It was right after I’d been talking about how lonely I felt, how I wished I had someone to celebrate my progress with. I thought he was just being... I don’t know, supportive? But deep down, I was hoping—\n\nMan: Hoping what? That he’d make a move?\n\nWoman: I mean... yeah. I’d been feeling this... tension for weeks. The way he’d look at me, hold eye contact a little too long. Sometimes he’d put his hand on my shoulder and it felt... different.\n\nMan: Wait, he was touching you during sessions? Isn’t that... not okay?\n\nWoman: It didn’t feel *wrong* at the time. It felt comforting. But then at the bar... we sat so close. And he reached over and held my hand.\n\nMan: He held your hand? While you were his patient? That’s... wow.\n\nWoman: I know. And he kept telling me how proud he was of me, how far I’d come... and honestly, that’s what got me. His words just... undid me. Next thing I knew, we were kissing.\n\nMan: Right there? In public?\n\nWoman: No, no—after. We left, and... we went back to his place.\n\nMan: *sighs* And you slept with him.\n\nWoman: Yeah. And it felt... intense, and surreal in the moment, but now? I’m just consumed with guilt. He crossed a line—a huge ethical line—and I let him. I *wanted* him to.\n\nMan: But he’s your therapist. He’s supposed to protect that boundary, not blur it.\n\nWoman: I know. And now I have to find someone new. Start over. I’m terrible at starting over... I don’t even know where to begin.\n\nMan: Are you going to report him?\n\nWoman: I don’t know. I’m scared. Part of me feels... used. Another part misses him. God, I’m so confused. I just... needed to tell someone.",
