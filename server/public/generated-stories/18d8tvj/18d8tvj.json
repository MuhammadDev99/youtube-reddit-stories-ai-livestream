    "description": "My(25m) girlfriend(26) confessed to cheating on me last night, so I told her I’ve been cheating the whole time we’ve been together.  I had my suspicions that she’s been cheating as she’s been staying out late and just acting strange in general.\n\n Well, when she made her big announcement I replied by saying I’ve been cheating on her for the entirety of our relationship, which isn’t true. I told her I’ve been sleeping with 1 other women consistently and this drove her absolutely insane - like I genuinely thought she was going to do someone rash, like slash my tires or something. But no, she just screamed at me and demanded to know who she was. She went on to say she only cheated once and she was completely inebriated when it happened as if that someone absolves her of any wrongdoing. The audacity. \n\nwell anyways, I broke up with her and threw her out of my house. I then proceeded to invite the boys over for some bbq. All in all, it was a hilarious experience. I know it’s not a crazy story, but I thought it was funny enough to share.",

I said I’d been sleeping with one other woman consistently for our entire relationship.\n\nWoman: Oh my god. And she totally bought it?\n\nMan: Completely lost it. Started screaming, demanding to know who it was. And then—get this—she tried to downplay her own cheating. Said she only did it *once* and she was “completely inebriated,” like that makes it okay.\n\nWoman: The audacity. So she thinks her one tipsy mistake is nothing compared to your full-blown affair?\n\nMan: Exactly. She was hysterical—I honestly thought she might key my car or something. But no, just a lot of yelling. So I broke up with her right then, threw her out, and called the boys over for a BBQ.\n\nWoman: You barbecued after that? That’s cold. But honestly? She deserved it. You had your suspicions anyway, right? With her staying out late and acting weird.\n\nMan: Yeah, for a while. I just didn’t have proof until she handed it to me. Honestly? Feels good. It’s over, and I got the last laugh.",
