    "description": "I used to work in a medical procedures unit in a hospital in the PNW. Patients would undergo endoscopic exams, which they were sedated for. We had an elderly gentleman patient this case and while we waited for the Doctor to arrive we engaged in friendly chit chat, nothing out of the ordinary. When the doc came in, he immediately asked us if the patient told us his history. I started rattling off the medical reasons why he was having the procedure and the doc cut me off saying “no his past work history as an undercover FBI mob agent”. Naturally my reaction was “ohhhhh no.. that must have been interesting, dealing with those mob guys”. The patients response has haunted me to this day. His exact words.\n\n“Those guys weren’t as bad as those mother fucking politicians” \n\nHe then went on to tell a story about how he was head of security for a “congressional event” in the 80s. He said another agent handed him the phone saying “congressman” wants to speak with you. \n\nThe conversation went as follows:\n\nCongressman: Will there be women there?\n\nAgent: Not sure what you mean.. but yes women are here.\n\nCongressman: When I arrive I want one sent to my room.. “NO OLDER THAN 13”.\n\nRight after he said that the CRNA pushed the meds and he passed out. We all just stood there in silence while he underwent the procedure.. what the fuck did he just tell us?\n\nEDIT: Apparently people are getting hung up on the use of the term “informant”.. so I removed it. For clarity, which I thought might have been deduced.. this old man was not a “Mob Informant” in the sense of being a snitch in the mob. He was a retired FBI agent who worked undercover with the mob at one point. In a completely separate point in time, he claimed to have been asked by a congressman for a 13 year old girl. This man had no reason to lie.. he didn’t even bring it up, the surgeon did.\n\nEDIT 2: \n\nThe story is 100% true as it happened.\n\nCould the old man be lieing, yes of course. Do I think he was, NO!\n\nThe procedure was an EGD “upper endoscopy”\n\nIt was a surgeon doing post operative surveillance, not a gastroenterologist.\n\nYou nay sayers need to understand that elite pedophile rings exist and have existed for a very long time. \n\nPeople taking this as a push for a political world view are wrong. I don’t have a political affiliation.\n\nFor everyone claiming “The FBI doesn’t work security or doesn’t work with congress. You are assuming you know what capacity this guy was working at every point of his career??\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI_Police#:~:text=The%20FBI%20Police%20is%20tasked,certain%20laws%20and%20administrative%20regulations.\n\n“Duties and responsibilities”\n\n“The FBI Police may be occasionally deployed to significant national security events, such as presidential inaugurations, the Super Bowl, conferences of world leaders as well as major political party conferences.”",

We were just doing pre-op chitchat, totally normal, elderly guy...\n\nMan: Wait, this is the endoscopy patient you mentioned last week?\n\nWoman: Yeah. So the surgeon comes in and asks if we knew about his background. I started listing his medical history, and the doctor cuts me off—\"No, his past as an undercover FBI agent who worked with the mob.\"\n\nMan: Whoa. For real? That’s wild.\n\nWoman: Right? So I said something like, \"Oh, dealing with the mob must’ve been intense.\" And then this old man looks right at us and says, \"Those guys weren’t as bad as those mother fucking politicians.\"\n\nMan: ...What? Politicians worse than mobsters? That’s a hell of a take.\n\nWoman: That’s what I thought too, but then he kept going. He said he was head of security for some congressional event back in the 80s. Another agent hands him a phone and says a congressman wants to talk to him.\n\nMan: Okay... and?\n\nWoman: So the congressman asks, \"Will there be women there?\" The agent says, \"Yeah, women are here,\" thinking it’s a normal question. And then the congressman says—I will never forget this—he says, \"When I arrive, I want one sent to my room... no older than 13.\"\n\nMan: ...No. No way. He did not just say that.\n\nWoman: He did. And the second the words were out of his mouth, the CRNA pushed the sedative and he went under. We all just stood there, completely silent, for the whole procedure. What the fuck, right?\n\nMan: But... wait. You’re sure he wasn’t confused? Or making it up? I mean, an undercover agent—couldn’t he have been lying?\n\nWoman: That’s the thing—he had zero reason to lie. He didn’t even bring it up himself; the surgeon did. And he said it so matter-of-factly, like it was just another Tuesday. I’ve never seen someone so... calm about something so horrific.\n\nMan: Jesus. And you really think it’s true?\n\nWoman: I do. I’ve turned it over in my head a thousand times. The way he said it, the timing... it felt real. And honestly, after working in medicine this long, nothing shocks me anymore—but this? This stuck with me.\n\nMan: That’s... I don’t even know what to say.\n\nWoman: Yeah. Me neither. I just keep thinking about it. Some days it feels like I’ll never unhear it.",
