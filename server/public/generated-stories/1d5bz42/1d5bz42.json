    "description": "I(45f) adopted my son(21m) when he was 12. He came from an abusive household and it took him a little bit to warm up to me. I remember one day, my cousin(42m) was visiting. My son had only been with me for 6 months and he was still pretty reserved. I was worried about him and I was terrified that I was doing something wrong. And then my cousin said something that will always stay with me. My cousin said \"he's okay now, it's just taking him a bit to get comfortable because he's been through some things. He has a good mom now.\"\n\nMy son started warming up to me shortly after that and he's grown so much. I've noticed that he's been way happier and way less reserved And he's a firefighter now and I'm so proud of him. When I first adopted him he was this short, scrawny kid and now he's so tall. He's muscular now, too, because he's a firefighter. He was 5'4 when I first adopted him and now he's 6'2. I'm only 5'9 and I have to look up when I talk to him. He grew so much and it was so gradual that I didn't notice until recently. He has a kind soul and he's a genuinely good person. I'm so proud of the person he's become and who he is today.",

He was still really quiet.\n\nWoman: So quiet. And I was just... terrified. Convinced I was messing everything up. I remember standing in the kitchen, just watching Leo sit on the couch, all folded into himself, and my heart was breaking.\n\nMan: God, I remember that phase. He hardly made eye contact with anyone.\n\nWoman: Exactly. And then Mark just... he put his hand on my shoulder and said, \"He's okay now. It's just taking him a bit to get comfortable because he's been through some things.\" \n\nMan: Wow.\n\nWoman: And then he said, \"He has a good mom now.\" I almost started crying right there in the kitchen.\n\nMan: That’s... that’s really what you needed to hear, huh?\n\nWoman: It was everything. I didn’t realize how much I was holding my breath until someone said it out loud. And you know what? It was like right after that, things started to shift. Slowly, but... he started to warm up.\n\nMan: And look at him now. A firefighter. I still can’t get over that.\n\nWoman: Me neither. I’m so proud of him I could burst. Remember how scrawny he was when I brought him home?\n\nMan: Yeah, he was what, 5'4\"?\n\nWoman: Exactly. And now? He’s 6'2\". I have to look up to talk to him. I didn’t even notice it happening—it was so gradual. All those years, just... growing.\n\nMan: And not just physically. You always say he has a kind soul.\n\nWoman: He does. After everything he went through... he’s just a good person. A genuinely good man. Sometimes I just look at him and my heart feels so full it could crack.\n\nMan: You did that. You gave him that space to become who he is.\n\nWoman: ...I guess I did. And I wouldn’t change a single second of it.",
