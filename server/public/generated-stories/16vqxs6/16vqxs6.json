    "description": "In college I met a girl at a house party. We drank and talked. Drank and talked. Drank and talked. Starting kissing. Tongues and all. \n\nShe asked me to the restroom with her. Of course, I said. She took me by the hand and led me away.  I went in first and she shut the door behind her and locked it. \n\nI was certain things were about to go to the next level. She said hang on and unzipped her pants. Sat down on the toilet. \n\nI thought she had to pee. Then she grunted. I heard a fart. Then a plop. \n\nI unlocked the door and ran. Never saw her again.",

  "content": "Man: You will not believe what I just remembered from college. I am cringing so hard right now.\n\nWoman: Oh god, what? You have that look. The one you get when you remember that time you tried to dye your hair black and it turned green.\n\nMan: No, no, this is so much worse. Way more traumatic. Remember that house party sophomore year? The one at that off-campus place with the sticky floors?\n\nWoman: Vaguely. There were a lot of those. You met a girl, didn't you? You always met a girl.\n\nMan: Yeah, yeah, I did. And we were hitting it off! Like, *really* hitting it off. We'd been drinking, talking for hours, and then we started making out. Like, proper, full-on, tongues-everywhere making out.\n\nWoman: Okay... standard college party success story. So what's the traumatic part? Did she have a boyfriend who showed up?\n\nMan: I wish. It would have been less humiliating. So, she's all over me, right? And then she takes my hand and asks me to go to the restroom with her.\n\nWoman: Ohhh. The classic 'let's go hook up in the bathroom' move. Smooth.\n\nMan: Exactly! That's what I thought! My brain was going, 'Yes! This is happening!' She leads me by the hand, we get in, she locks the door behind us. I'm thinking, 'This is it. Next level.'\n\nWoman: Wait, so... what happened? Did she just want to talk? Was she gonna do her makeup?\n\nMan: I swear to god, I thought we were on the same page. But then she goes, 'Hang on,' and she... she unzips her pants.\n\nWoman: Okay... still seems like it's heading in the right direction? Maybe a little forward but—\n\nMan: And then she sits down. On the toilet.\n\nWoman: ...On the toilet? The toilet-toilet?\n\nMan: Yes! The toilet! And I'm just standing there, frozen, thinking, 'Okay, she just has to pee really quick. No big deal. We'll get back to it.'\n\nWoman: Oh no.\n\nMan: Oh yes. Then I heard it. A grunt. Then... a fart. And then the most horrifying, definitive *plop* you have ever heard in your life.\n\nWoman: NO. She did NOT. She took you into a bathroom to... to *poop*? While you were in there?\n\nMan: She locked the door! She locked me in a tiny bathroom with her while she took a dump! I didn't even wait. I just fumbled with the lock, flung the door open, and ran. I sprinted straight out of that house and never, ever looked back. I never saw her again.\n\nWoman: I... I have no words. That might be the most insane thing I've ever heard. I'm so sorry.\n\nMan: I mean, honestly, I'm just scarred. I still get flashbacks every time a bathroom door locks. I thought it was a sure thing. I was so, so wrong.",
