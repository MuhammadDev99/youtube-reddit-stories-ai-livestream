    "description": "My husband has a \"work wife\", they are friends who go out to lunch often and tease each other and talk about some personal things. She brings him homemade lunches sometimes and he's brought her left over desserts (that I made!). It didn't bother me at first, but it feels like she has a connection to him that I don't.\n\nTo make matters worse she \"work-proposed\" to him to \"make their work-relationship work-official\", she playfully feels like he's not a real work husband if they don't have an actual work wedding. He thinks it's hilarious, and their manager said it's a fine excuse to throw a party out of their pizza party funds--they throw celebratory parties somewhat often when they ship a product or land a big client. The parties are usually a few grand in food and drinks and entertainment. His company is a dream come true but I think him and his friend are taking this too far. He was planning on wearing his normal work clothes to the \"wedding\" but there's rumors she's going to wear her wedding dress from her failed marriage (she's been divorced for 5 years).\n\nWhat should I do? I told him this is ridiculous but he keeps talking me down.  I'm considering showing up to respectfully voice my concerns during the \"if anyone has objections\" part of the ceremony. His coworkers know me from the last Christmas party and the time I had to bring him a clean pair of pants so I know they'd let me into the party. It's in the middle of the day so I'd need to take time off work but if I can stop their marriage maybe I can save mine.",

  "content": "Man: Okay, start from the beginning. You said he was planning his work-wedding outfit?\n\nWoman: (Takes a shaky breath) Yeah. He was just...casually talking about wearing his normal slacks and button-down to the ceremony. Like it’s no big deal. Meanwhile, I heard through the grapevine that she’s planning to wear her actual wedding dress. From her first marriage.\n\nMan: Wait, her actual wedding dress? The one from her divorce? That’s...incredibly weird. And he’s okay with that?\n\nWoman: He thinks it’s hilarious! He keeps saying it’s all a big joke, that it’s just an excuse for the team to have a party. But it doesn’t feel like a joke. It feels like she’s...staking a claim. And he’s letting her.\n\nMan: Hold on—she’s the one who “work-proposed,” right? What does that even mean?\n\nWoman: She got down on one knee in the middle of the office, apparently. Told him they needed to “make it work-official.” And their manager approved using party funds for it! They’re going to have a whole fake wedding, with a ceremony, at the office. In the middle of a Tuesday.\n\nMan: And he didn’t shut it down? He didn’t say, “Hey, this is making my actual wife uncomfortable?”\n\nWoman: (Voice tight) No. When I told him it was ridiculous, he just laughed and said I was overreacting. That it’s “just work fun.” But it’s not fun for me. She already brings him homemade lunches, he gives her my desserts...it’s like she has a piece of him I don’t. And now they’re playing house at work with a budget of a few thousand dollars and a wedding dress.\n\nMan: So what are you going to do? You can’t just let this happen.\n\nWoman: I’m thinking about going. To the “wedding.” I’d have to take time off, but...I know most of his coworkers. I could show up, and when they do that “speak now or forever hold your peace” bit...I could stand up. Respectfully. Voice my concerns. In front of everyone.\n\nMan: Whoa. That’s bold. You think that’ll work? Or just make him angry?\n\nWoman: I don’t know. Maybe both. But if I don’t do something to stop their “marriage,” I’m scared it’s going to keep eroding ours. I feel like I’m losing him to a joke—to his “work wife” and a party. And I’m not laughing.",
