    "description": "TLDR: I’m divorcing my husband because of his farts. But for the love, please read the whole thing before you comment. Fr. \n\nI truly wish this were a joke. Part of this whole situation is on me for not dating him for a long time before we got married, and a big chunk of that dating was spent having completely lost my sense of smell from Covid. That fact alone is absolutely unbelievable but it’s true. Side note, I got my smell back. The other wild part is that when we were dating, he hung over at my place mainly, and I didn’t carry a lot of unhealthy snacks for him to snack on at night. This fact is VERY relevant for the story.\n\nOnce we got married, things went downhill very quickly. He started inhailing as many snacks and as much dairy as possible at night. Sometimes he would go out and get a deep dish, fried cheese, loaded pizza and devour it at 11 PM after eating an entire bag of greasy chips and like 27 pieces of taffy. And a glass of milk. Or 3. \n\nAt first I thought it was just a bad fart here and there. But as the nights progressed, I realized that the bad farts were becoming a nightly nightmare. \n\nI know what normal stinky farts are. Even bad sulfuric farts. But, these are not simply either of those. These farts are incompatible with life itself. \n\nThe first time one really hit me in the face, I projectile vomited. I could taste them. They were are almost tangible objects in the air. I’m convinced they are soaked into the carpet and walls. Rotten egg is not even enough to describe what the smell is. It’s almost as if something literally died inside of his stomach and was leaking into the air trying to kill anyone that smells it. \n\nHis farts are not human. They are not silly little rotten egg farts. There is something wrong with him. Truly. These farts are almost alive with a mind of their own, and they are terrifying. If there was a horror movie made about farts, it would be about his.\n\nThey are unsettling at best. They make your mind feel like something bad happened, perhaps a murder. Your spirit does not feel settled because these are not normal farts in anyway at all. These are violently horrifying.\n\nIt got to the point where I had to stop sleeping in our bedroom the second month of marriage. Not only that, but I had to blast the AC, stuff towels under our door, stuff towels under my daughter’s door, turn the fan on in both rooms, and sleep in her room with her. He snuck into her room and farted when I was almost asleep so that I would start dry heaving. I had to start sleeping with the door locked with her.\n\nI started routine prescription nausea medicine to keep my food down at night, just in case, because it was becoming kind of health hazard because of how sick it was making me.\n\nWhen I asked him if he thought the amount of food he was inhaling every night was causing his farts, he said yes. I asked if maybe he could slow down or substitute for healthier snacks, such as sea salt popcorn, or a bit lighter and less full of thick cheese snacks, and he said no. His reasoning? He said he likes the way the farts feel exiting his butt as they vibrate his prostate and butt hole. Like I’m not even kidding-HE FREAKING SAID THAT.\n\nI’m so horrified that I even typed that.\n\nMy life became a living nightmare as I could no longer sleep in my room and also remain alive. My desk was in my room, so I also had to stop working in the daytime from my bedroom. He works from home in the bedroom too. I had to change the entire situation just to cater to the pleasure of his farts. \n\n I tried desperately to get him to go to a doctor, I found referrals to gastroenterologists, I bought him probiotics enzymes, milk substitutes, I cooked healthy meals, he would literally tell me he didn’t want the healthy meal and drive himself to Taco Bell instead. He refused to go to the doctor. He took the probiotic sometimes but usually just pretended to and slipped them by his nightstand so I wouldn’t see that he didn’t take them.\n\nKnowing I was going to have to remain on prescription nausea meds, possibly for life, just to cohabitate with this man was so mind blowing. Our budget was going crazy to keep up with the demands of the amount of food needed to keep his farting for pleasure needs met. At one point, he literally inhaled so much food so fast and so nonstop that he gained 12 pounds in 48 hours and he looked at the scale and screamed. \n\nI tried to get him into therapy and a psychiatrist, but no. I am a very body positive person that does not fat shame and genuinely believes that you should eat what makes you feel healthy and good and not worry about hitting some numbers on a scale.\n\nThe situation, however, feels like a very disastrous issue that is very weird and not very common, something that people probably can’t relate to because it’s just completely absurd in every way. \n\nHe said he will always choose that vibrational fart feeling and the fart smell and the grease snacks and the cheese above me. He said that is a hill he is forever willing to die on.\n\nAnyway, that is the story of why I am divorcing my husband over farts. On the surface level, I know it sounds like it’s just about farts and then I’m just a really shallow wife, but I think it’s actually so much deeper. It’s just hard to explain how.",

It's like something died inside him and is trying to kill anyone who smells it.\n\nMan: Jesus. That's... graphic. But couldn't he change his diet or something? Go to a doctor?\n\nWoman: That's the worst part! I begged him! I found gastroenterologists, bought probiotics, cooked healthy meals... He'd literally tell me he didn't want my cooking and drive to Taco Bell instead. And when I asked why he wouldn't even try...\n\nMan: Why?\n\nWoman: He said... God, I can't believe I'm saying this out loud. He said he likes the way they feel exiting his body. That the vibration feels good on his... you know.\n\nMan: No. No way. He actually said that?\n\nWoman: Word for word. Said that's a hill he's willing to die on. He's choosing cheese snacks and vibrational fart feelings over me.\n\nMan: But wait—you guys just got married! Didn't he want this life with you? Kids? A home?\n\nWoman: That's what makes it so devastating. I had to stop sleeping in our bedroom by the second month. I'm sleeping with our daughter now because he actually snuck into her room and farted while I was almost asleep just to make me dry heave. I'm on prescription nausea meds just to function.\n\nMan: That's... that's actually abusive. It's not about the farts anymore, is it?\n\nWoman: No. It's about him choosing his disgusting pleasure over my basic wellbeing. Over our family's peace. I can't live in a house that smells like a biological hazard, budgeting for his endless snack runs just to keep his... habit going.\n\nMan: I'm so sorry. You're not shallow—you're protecting yourself.\n\nWoman: I know. It just hurts that after everything, I'm becoming the \"honeycomb wife\" who left over something that sounds ridiculous.
