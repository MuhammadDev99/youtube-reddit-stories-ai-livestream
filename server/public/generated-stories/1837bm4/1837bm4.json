    "description": "Edit: Reading through the comments made me realize I screwed up the title.\n\nIt should probably be: My boyfriend made me realize I was bi\n\nI(24f) thought I was a lesbian until I met my boyfriend(20m). My whole life until last year, I've only dated women, and I get grossed out thinking of myself with a guy. My boyfriend and I met at an event we both volunteered for, and we became friends. We got closer, and I started thinking about him more and more. When I realized that I developed feelings for him, it terrified me. My whole life, I'd thought I was a lesbian, and then I developed feelings for a guy. Everything I knew was wrong. I tried distancing myself from him in hopes the feelings would go away, but they didn't. I kept thinking about him, and I eventually gave in and asked him out. Once I convinced him that I wasn't joking, he accepted, and we started dating.\n\nDating him wasn't that different than dating a girl. The sex was so weird, but he was so accommodating. The first couple of times, he made sure I was comfortable and he was so careful and gentle. The thought of me with any other guy still grosses me out, but being with my boyfriend makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. I have no idea why he's the only guy I like, but the year we've been together has been probably the best year of my life. He gets me, and he gives the best hugs. We live together, and he's an amazing roommate and an amazing boyfriend.\n\nEdit: spelling",

Weren’t you the one who said thinking about guys grossed you out?\n\nWoman: Yeah, I did! And I meant it! That’s what made it so terrifying when I started catching feelings for him. I felt like my whole world was just… wrong.\n\nMan: So what changed? Was it just him, or…?\n\nWoman: Honestly, I think it *is* just him. The thought of being with any other guy still makes me uncomfortable. But with him… it’s different. He’s just so… gentle. The first few times we were intimate, he was so careful—making sure I was comfortable, never pushing.\n\nMan: That’s actually really sweet. But wait, you said dating him wasn’t that different from dating a woman?\n\nWoman: Emotionally, yeah. He gets me. We live together now, and he’s an amazing roommate, too. And his hugs… God, he gives the best hugs.\n\nMan: So you’re happy?\n\nWoman: Yeah. Really happy. It’s been the best year of my life. I still don’t totally get why he’s the exception, but… I’m not questioning it anymore.",
