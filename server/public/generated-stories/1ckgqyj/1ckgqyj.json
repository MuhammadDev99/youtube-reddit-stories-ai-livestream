    "description": "I (25M) was invited to a funeral by my boss 2 days ago. I've worked for her for almost 6 years, and we are acquaintances even outside of work. So when her father died and she invited me to the gathering at her place, I felt like I couldn't say no.\n\nI woke up today and realized i didn't want to go. I'm terrible at talking to grieving people, but I forced myself to be there. I don't know anyone here, and everyone is in their 50s. I pretty much don't exist. My boss has come to see me a few times but I still feel out of place. Now I'm on my phone until I feel it's been long enough so I can leave.\n\nMy gut told me to stay home. I should have listened. I'm never going to a funeral in these circumstances unless someone comes with me. Learn from my mistakes.\n\n25 minutes to go...\n\n\nEDIT: I take it back. One hour of boredom and feeling like I don't belong for 10 minutes of bonding. My boss showed me a video of her dad teaching a class. As she did, she poured herself to me. She talked about her dad and how important he was to her. She has so much love for him, and it touched me. I'm kind of teary-eyed. I'm glad I was here because I think she needed that 10 minutes of sharing.",

  "content": "Man: I’m telling you, I should’ve just stayed home.\n\nWoman: Wait, I thought you said you were glad you went? Didn’t you just text me like an hour ago saying it was actually a good thing?\n\nMan: I know, I know. But for the first hour I was miserable. I’m 25, dude. Everyone there was in their 50s. I literally just stood in the corner scrolling on my phone, trying to look busy.\n\nWoman: Oh god, that sounds awful. But your boss invited you personally, right? You’ve worked for her for like six years—it makes sense she’d want you there.\n\nMan: Yeah, and I felt like I couldn’t say no. But my gut was screaming at me the whole morning. “Don’t go, you’re terrible at this stuff.” And I was right—for the first hour, I was a ghost. No one even looked at me.\n\nWoman: So what changed? You sounded totally different in your last message.\n\nMan: Okay, so my boss came over to me finally. She looked wrecked, but she pulled out her phone and showed me this video of her dad teaching a class. And she just… opened up. Told me all these stories about him, how much he meant to her.\n\nWoman: Oh wow.\n\nMan: Yeah, she was crying a little, and honestly… I got kind of emotional too. It was only like ten minutes, but it felt real. She needed someone to listen, and I was there.\n\nWoman: So it wasn’t a total waste.\n\nMan: No, it wasn’t. But I’m still never doing this alone again. Next time, I’m bringing someone with me. I’m glad I stuck it out, but man… that first hour was brutal.\n\nWoman: I get it. You powered through for her.\n\nMan: Exactly. And I’m actually… glad I did. Even if I never want to do it again.",
