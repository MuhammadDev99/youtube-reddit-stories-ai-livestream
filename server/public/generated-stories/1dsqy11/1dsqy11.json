    "description": "So, about 3 weeks ago I flew to South Korea for a vacation with friends who live there. My husband didn't want to go and said he'd be fine staying home and watching the house and dog. I trusted him because he's a 40 year old adult man and assumed he'd be able to feed himself like a sane person despite him possessing the cooking ability of a cactus. I was wrong. I should've dragged him and the dog along with me to another country.\n\nWhat my husband decided to do during his 3 weeks without me was absurd. I would've been happier if he'd cheated on me instead. Because what he did was: order nothing but Taco Bell through DoorDash after he: somehow broke my stove by: cooking an entire 15lbs bag of red lentils all at once. Then he didn't bother to get a bowl for his lentils, he just ate them straight from the pot and stuffed the pot into the fridge and broke one of the shelves inside it. Now realizing his mistake, he decided to order nothing but terrible tacos for the remaining 2 weeks while getting high on medical marijuana. Also for some reason he bought a bunch of honeycombs from one of our friend's fathers and decided those made a good snack and has eaten nothing but beeswax and honey for the last few days because he's some kind of weird alien in a human disguise. Apparently honeycombs give you gas. And lentils give you gas. And *Taco Bell* gives you gas.\n\nSo now it's today and I'm awoken by what sounds like someone revving a motorcycle in my bedroom followed by the stench of the fiery pits of hell itself. It's 5:30 in the morning. He gets up and goes to use the toilet as I'm opening the windows in a poor attempt to ventilate the house but it's too late. He doesn't even have a solid poop, it's just 10 minutes of gas. Like 20 seconds of nonstop farts followed by a huge gasp of air and then another 20 seconds of gas. By this time, the dog has hidden under my couch because it doesn't know what those loud honking noises are and fears for its safety. I consider joining it, but continue to open every window in my house. It's 62 degrees out and windy. The wind just blows the fart smell around the house. My husband has left the bathroom and has walked upstairs. It sounds like there's a small 2-stroke engine in his pants. \n\nI can't take it anymore and scream that I'm going to get breakfast at the diner and leave him. I bring the dog with me because the dog follows me out of the house because it also doesn't want to be here right now. So now I'm at the diner waiting for my husband to de-gas himself while the dog sits underneath the table next to me wearing a pink leash-kid harness that my friends bought for *me* as a gag gift that has *my* name and \"Emotional Support Human\" on it that the waitress thought was some kind of in-joke. \n\nThis is the start of my morning. I hope it's not as stinky as yours.",

Did something happen with Mark?\n\nWoman: Oh, just that my husband has apparently turned our home into a human gas chamber. I’m sitting at the diner right now because I had to evacuate. With the dog.\n\nMan: Wait, what? I thought he was fine holding down the fort while you were in Korea. What did he do?\n\nWoman: Remember how I said he couldn’t cook? I underestimated him. Somehow, he managed to break our stove.\n\nMan: How do you break a stove?\n\nWoman: By trying to cook an entire 15-pound bag of red lentils. All at once.\n\nMan: *laughs* You’re kidding. What, did it explode?\n\nWoman: I wish that was the weirdest part. He didn’t even use a bowl—just ate them straight from the pot, then shoved the whole thing in the fridge and broke one of the shelves.\n\nMan: So he broke the stove *and* the fridge? In three weeks?\n\nWoman: And then decided his only option was to order nothing but Taco Bell for two weeks while getting high on his medical marijuana.\n\nMan: Okay, that’s gross, but… why are you at a diner at, what, 6 a.m.?\n\nWoman: Because this morning, at 5:30, I woke up to what sounded like a motorcycle revving in our bedroom. Followed by the actual stench of hell.\n\nMan: Oh no. The lentils… and Taco Bell…\n\nWoman: And get this—he also bought a bunch of honeycombs from our friend’s dad and has been snacking on straight beeswax and honey. Like some kind of alien impersonating a human.\n\nMan: Honeycomb? That’s… weird. And gassy. Very, very gassy.\n\nWoman: Exactly. So he stumbles to the bathroom, and it’s not even solid—just ten minutes of nonstop gas. Twenty seconds of farting, a huge gasp, then another twenty. The dog hid under the couch, terrified.\n\nMan: You’re joking. The dog was scared of his farts?\n\nWoman: Yes! I almost joined him. I threw open every window—it’s 62 and windy outside—and the wind just swirled the smell around the house. Then he walks upstairs and it sounds like a two-stroke engine is following him in his pants.\n\nMan: *laughing* I’m sorry, it’s horrible but… it’s also kind of hilarious.\n\nWoman: It was not hilarious at 5:30 a.m. I finally screamed that I was leaving him and getting breakfast. The dog bolted out with me—he didn’t want to stay either.\n\nMan: So now you’re… what, just waiting it out?\n\nWoman: Yep. At the diner. And the dog is under the table wearing that pink “Emotional Support Human” harness my friends got me as a joke. The waitress thinks it’s some kind of ironic statement.\n\nMan: Honestly, it kind of is. So what are you gonna do? Go back when the air clears?\n\nWoman: I don’t know. Part of me wants to just… keep driving. I can’t believe a 40-year-old man self-destructed this badly in three weeks. I should’ve dragged him to Korea.\n\nMan: Yeah, maybe next time. For now… enjoy your breakfast. And maybe buy him some Beano on your way home.\n\nWoman: I’m not going home until he’s aired out. Or until I’ve filed for divorce. Whichever comes first.",
