    "description": "Me and my wife have been together for more or less around 5 years. I had met her at work, she was the manager and I was one of the line cooks working in the back kitchen.\n     I had my suspicions when we first had our son, we decided that it was best I become a stay at home dad while she worked as she had made so much more money than I did as she was a general manager.\n    First she started saying things like she had to go to work parties as it was mandatory or she’d be fired or she was staying late at work because people had called off and it was busy.\n     One day she had come on to me being very flirty and persuading me To have sex with her. Now that I look back I think she was already pregnant at this point and wanted it to look like I had gotten her knocked up. \n    Of course like any man would I fucked her and came inside. About a month later she was telling me she was pregnant, I was cool with it why not. \n       When it came down to having our second son I noticed that about a year into it, he looked nothing like me or my wife, keep in mind we are both WHITE, I have blond hair and brown eyes, my skin is super pale and my wife is just almost the same. This kid the more he grew was really dark skinned Mexican hair and looked like one of the guys you’d see from the Mexican revolution with the big ole mustaches… I mean when I say Mexican he looked like the typical stereotype of one.\n   I’m thinking about getting a dna test and leaving her because there’s no way it’s mine. Lmk if you guys want a part 2",

  "content": "Man: I just... I can't do this anymore. I think I'm gonna get a DNA test and leave her.\n\nWoman: Wait, what? Slow down. Start from the beginning. You and Sarah have been together for five years, right? What's going on?\n\nMan: It's about the second kid, Liam. He's... he's just not mine. I'm sure of it.\n\nWoman: What do you mean? He's a year old, right? Did something happen?\n\nMan: Yeah, about a year in, I started noticing... look, we're both white, right? I'm blond, pale, brown eyes. Sarah's practically the same. But Liam... his skin is getting darker, he's got this thick, dark hair... he looks like one of those guys from the Mexican revolution with the big mustaches. I'm not even joking.\n\nWoman: Whoa. Okay, that is... really different. But are you sure? Sometimes kids don't look like either parent right away.\n\nMan: No, this is beyond that. And it's not just how he looks. I've been thinking about the timing. Remember when she got super flirty out of nowhere about a month before she told me she was pregnant?\n\nWoman: Yeah, you mentioned that. You thought it was weird at the time.\n\nMan: I think she was already pregnant. I think she came onto me and convinced me to have sex so she could say it was mine.\n\nWoman: Oh my god. That's... that's calculated. But wait, didn't she used to say she had to stay late for work parties? Mandatory stuff?\n\nMan: Exactly! She was always \"working late\" or at \"mandatory parties.\" I was home with our first son, being the stay-at-home dad because she made more money as the manager. I trusted her.\n\nWoman: So you think she was...?\n\nMan: Yeah. I think she was cheating. Probably with someone from work. And now I'm raising this kid who isn't mine, and she thinks I have no idea.\n\nWoman: That's... I don't even have words. Are you going to confront her?\n\nMan: Not yet. I'm getting a DNA test first. I need to be sure. But honestly, in my gut, I already know. There's no way he's mine.\n\nWoman: What are you gonna do if it's not?\n\nMan: I'm leaving her. I can't stay with someone who would do this. It's just... it's too much.\n\nWoman: I'm so sorry. That's heartbreaking.\n\nMan: Yeah. It is. But I've made up my mind. I need to know the truth.",
