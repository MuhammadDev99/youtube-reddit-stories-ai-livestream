    "description": "My(27f) boyfriend(23m) has been really romantic lately. I got home this morning and he was in a really good mood when I picked him up in the afternoon. \n\nHe showered when we got home and went to a park. We walked around for a while and went to the aquarium(the aquarium is on the park grounds). We grabbed dinner at a restaurant near by and we found a nice spot to watch the sunset afterward. Today was perfect. My boyfriend is always romantic, but lately, he's dialing up the romance and I love it. We just got back home and we're relaxing on the couch. We're watching a movie and we have all the lights off, just candles. It's so romantic, I feel so happy when I'm with him.\n\nEdit: my boyfriend is a construction worker. That's why he showered when he got home.\n\nUpdate: He proposed",

  "content": "Man: Wait, wait, wait—you just got home from all that? So he’s been extra romantic lately, but today was like… next level?\n\nWoman: Yeah, honestly, I’m still floating. We got back from the park, the aquarium, dinner, sunset watching… and now we’re just here on the couch, candles lit, movie on. It’s so perfect.\n\nMan: Okay, but hold up—you said he’s a construction worker, right? So he showered right when you guys got home?\n\nWoman: Yeah, exactly. He came home all dusty, but he cleaned up fast. Then we went straight out. And honestly, he’s always sweet, but lately it’s like he’s hitting a “reset button” on romance or something. I mean, hugging me while we walked, holding my hand the whole time at the aquarium…\n\nMan: That’s… really sweet. But also, kind of intense out of nowhere, no? I mean, did he say why he’s dialing it up like this?\n\nWoman: Not really. He’s just been… present. More attentive. Like during the sunset, he kept his arm around me the whole time, didn’t even check his phone once.\n\nMan: Huh. And you had no clue? Nothing felt off or… planned?\n\nWoman: I mean, it felt special, but I didn’t think too much of it. Until…\n\nMan: Until what?\n\nWoman: …He paused the movie. Got down on one knee. Right there, in the candlelight.\n\nMan: No. Way. He proposed? Are you serious?!\n\nWoman: Yeah. He did. I’m… engaged. I’m shaking just saying it.\n\nMan: Oh my god, that’s… wow. Congratulations! You must be over the moon.\n\nWoman: I really am. It all makes sense now—the extra effort, the perfect day… He was building up to this. I’ve never felt happier in my life.",
