    "description": "My 28 year old sister gave birth to her first daughter 2 weeks ago. I 17f was in the hospital together with my parents and her husband. The birth went pretty smooth, although she was screaming so loud.. I was so excited to be an auntie and holding my newborn niece in my arms was a precious moment. \n\nEverything seemed fine afterwards . My sister came home about 3 days later and she and her husband stayed with me and my parents as they needed help to take care of the baby. But 2 days after she came home, she was experiencing exhaustion, pain in her body, and she constantly fainting.\nShe kept insisting that she was fine but our mother said that fainting is not \"fine\" and brought her back to the hospital, where they discovered an infection or internal bleeding or both somewhere in her body and they were unable to treat it in time despite giving her mounds of antibiotics before she passed away 2 days later. \n\nA week has passed since, and 3 days since the funeral. I can't stop crying and thinking that if the doctors had noticed that something was wrong, my sister could still be alive. \n\nI loved my sister to death. She was my role model growing up. Now I lost her forever and only have my niece, who is completely unaware of what's going on. I'm sad, and angry, and upset and I miss my big sister so freaking much... I can't talk about this with my friends and she was my only sibling. My parents aren't helping much as they're also grieving, so I don't know what I'm expecting to get from here but I'm just a complete freaking wreck.",

It's been a week and it still doesn't feel real.\n\nMan: Your sister? God, I'm so sorry. The funeral was just a few days ago, right?\n\nWoman: Yeah. Three days. And it's just... it all happened so fast. We were all there when she gave birth, you know? I was holding my niece and everything seemed perfect.\n\nMan: Wait, I thought everything went smoothly with the delivery?\n\nWoman: It did! That's what makes it worse! She came home after three days and then... then she just started falling apart. She kept fainting, saying she was fine, but...\n\nMan: Fainting isn't fine. Especially after having a baby. Your mom took her back to the hospital?\n\nWoman: Yeah, thank god she did. They found some... infection or internal bleeding, they weren't even totally sure. They pumped her full of antibiotics but... *(voice breaks)* they couldn't save her. Two days later she was just... gone.\n\nMan: Jesus. And she was only 28. That's... I can't even process that.\n\nWoman: Neither can I. I keep thinking if the doctors had noticed something sooner... She was screaming so much during labor, maybe that was a sign? I don't know. I'm just so angry.\n\nMan: Of course you are. She was your big sister. You always said she was your role model.\n\nWoman: *(crying softly)* She was everything to me. And now my niece will never know her mom. She's just sleeping peacefully, completely unaware that her mom is... gone. And my parents... they're just destroyed. I can't even talk to them about it.\n\nMan: You don't have to deal with this alone. I'm here, okay? However messy it gets.\n\nWoman: I know... it's just... I'm a complete wreck. I miss her so much it physically hurts. I don't know how I'm supposed to just... keep going.\n\nMan: You don't have to figure that out today. Just... breathe.\n\nWoman: *(takes a shaky breath)* I'm trying. I'm really trying. But right now... it just feels like this huge, awful hole where she used to be. And I don't know how to fill it.",
