    "description": "Four days ago I was walking with a coworker on a break just to stretch our legs. We work in an office setting so like to get up every once in a while and get some fresh air. We walk in a half circle around the building. In the back there are stairs that we like to go down and then back up on our way back for exercise. It's two sets of 15 concrete steps.\n\nIt was a beautiful sunny day with blue skies. Near the top of the stairs we were in mid-conversation while heading down and all of a sudden I hear him go \"Oh god\" and trip and fall somehow. He rolled down and landed at the bottom in a heap, face first in the concrete. I just stared for a few seconds because it was so sudden. I ran to the bottom while asking if he's ok, but he didn't move or respond. I got close and realized there was blood coming from his head and face and his arms and legs were seized up and stiff when I tried to roll him over.\n\nI freaked out but managed to call 911 while also texting another coworker friend of mine to come outside the office because our friend fell. 911 told me to roll him over and do CPR while they came, which I did.\n\nThe ambulance got there about 7 minutes after I called and took him to the hospital, but I'm 99% sure he was already dead when I was doing CPR\n\nI feel really weird about it. Like sad, but also just strange. It's hard to put into words. It doesn't seem real. I will get flashes where I realize what happened and feel an intense tightness in my chest and the severity of it hits me. I keep imagining him laying at the bottom of the stairs face down, and also his torn up face when I was giving him CPR when he was already dead. It's also just really sad because he was one of my best friends at work. I've barely slept since Tuesday, and was full of adrenaline for a full day after it happened.\n\nHe was single with no kids or anything. Only has a brother and father who live in other states.\n\nI don't really know why I'm writing all this but I just feel really strange and am wondering if anyone ever experienced something like this.\n\nEDIT: Didn't expect this post to get so much traction. I appreciate all the advice and positive thoughts sent my way. It saddens me that many of you have similar experiences. I can't respond to every comment but I am reading every single one. Thank you!",

It was such a nice day—blue sky, sun out. We were talking about... I don't even remember what. Heading down those back stairs...\n\nMan: The concrete ones by the loading dock?\n\nWoman: Yeah. We were near the top and he just... he suddenly goes \"Oh god\" and just trips. It happened so fast. He just rolled all the way down. Two full sets of stairs.\n\nMan: Jesus. And he landed face first?\n\nWoman: Yeah. In a heap at the bottom. I just froze for a second—it was so sudden. Then I ran down screaming if he was okay. But he wasn't moving. When I got close I saw the blood... coming from his head. And his limbs were all stiff when I tried to turn him over.\n\nMan: Fuck. And you had to do CPR?\n\nWoman: The 911 operator told me to. I was giving chest compressions while his... his face was just... torn up. I knew he was already gone. I could feel it.\n\nMan: But the ambulance came pretty fast, right?\n\nWoman: Seven minutes. Felt like hours. They took him but... I was just there with his blood on my hands. He was one of my best friends here.\n\nMan: I'm so sorry. Have you talked to his family?\n\nWoman: Just his brother. He didn't have a wife or kids or anything. It's just... it doesn't feel real. I keep getting these flashes—him at the bottom of the stairs, the way he looked during CPR...\n\nMan: Have you slept at all?\n\nWoman: Barely. Since Tuesday? I've been running on pure adrenaline and... this weird numbness. I'll just be doing dishes and then—*bam*—my chest gets tight and it all hits me again.\n\nMan: You shouldn't be alone right now. Do you want me to stay over tonight?\n\nWoman: Honestly? Yeah. I think... I think I just need to not be by myself with this. I still can't believe it happened.",
