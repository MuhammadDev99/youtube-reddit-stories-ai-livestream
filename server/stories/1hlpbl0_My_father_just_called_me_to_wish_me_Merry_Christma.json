  "description": "Just need to vent. As title says, I've been homeless for 3 months. My father lives about an hour away from the Library/Park/Taco Bell/Dunkin Donuts where I spend time.\n\nHe lives with his wife. They have a 2-floor house. His wife's son and his wife live on the second floor. They have a fully finished basement. When I was about to become homeless, I asked to stay there for a few months so I could get back on my feet. Answer was \"absolutely not.\" \n\nWhat kind of sadistic fucking behavior is this ? Two days ago, it was 15 degrees Fahrenheit outside. He hasnt responded to my phone calls for 2 months or so. But calls me to wish me Merry Christmas????\n\nThanks for reading. I guess merry Christmas to you all.",
