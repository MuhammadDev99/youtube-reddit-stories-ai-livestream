  "description": "I (25M) was invited to a funeral by my boss 2 days ago. I've worked for her for almost 6 years, and we are acquaintances even outside of work. So when her father died and she invited me to the gathering at her place, I felt like I couldn't say no.\n\nI woke up today and realized i didn't want to go. I'm terrible at talking to grieving people, but I forced myself to be there. I don't know anyone here, and everyone is in their 50s. I pretty much don't exist. My boss has come to see me a few times but I still feel out of place. Now I'm on my phone until I feel it's been long enough so I can leave.\n\nMy gut told me to stay home. I should have listened. I'm never going to a funeral in these circumstances unless someone comes with me. Learn from my mistakes.\n\n25 minutes to go...\n\n\nEDIT: I take it back. One hour of boredom and feeling like I don't belong for 10 minutes of bonding. My boss showed me a video of her dad teaching a class. As she did, she poured herself to me. She talked about her dad and how important he was to her. She has so much love for him, and it touched me. I'm kind of teary-eyed. I'm glad I was here because I think she needed that 10 minutes of sharing.",
