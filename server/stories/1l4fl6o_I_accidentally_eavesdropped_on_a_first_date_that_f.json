  "description": "I was at a restaurant just outside Boston mid-range, nothing fancy, but nice enough for a date. I was early. My friend, running late. So I had about 20 minutes of solo time at my table. Next to me, in the same booth but technically a separate table, sat a young couple who looked to be in their mid-20s. They arrived a minute after I did.\n\nAcross from me (and to my left) sat a man: heavyset, pale, with a bright red beard and the posture of someone either very tired or permanently unimpressed. Across from him, beside me, sat a young woman with expressive eyes, neat makeup, and a polite energy that I could feel even from my seat. It was clearly a first date.\n\nShe smiled. He grunted. She talked. He sipped a whiskey cocktail. She ordered a wine asked for it to come with her meal, but they brought it early. She laughed and thanked the server anyway.\n\nAnd then… the conversation started.\n\nAt first, it was small talk the kind where one person tries to make it work and the other seems to be calculating how long is polite before leaving. I started jotting things down, not with judgment, but curiosity. I do this sometimes when alone in public: like sketching, but with words. A habit from long subway rides and solo lunches.\n\nShe admitted this was her first app date. He said he’d been on a lot. Silence.\n\nShe asked him if he wanted to know anything about her.\n\nHe responded, “Sure. Like what?”\n\nShe tried again asked about plumbing. He said he was a journeyman but that there’s “no difference, really.”\n\nShe tried to relate: “I went to school for four years for my job. I always admired people who just dove into work.”\n\nHe said he had a degree. In Communications.\n\nShe blinked. “Oh! That’s cool. Surprising, but cool.”\n\nHe said nothing.\n\nShe confessed she gets nervous on dates and talks too much. Invited him to jump in. He told her, “You’re fine.”\n\nShe asked if he’d always lived nearby. He said, “Whole life.”\n\nShe launched into a story she grew up on a houseboat. Her parents studied whales. “Like George on Seinfeld, but real.” She smiled, looking for a connection.\n\nHe asked if you can eat whales.\n\nShe paused. “Um. No.”\n\nShe asked if he was okay. Offered to reschedule if it wasn’t a good night. He said, “You’re fine.”\n\nShe laughed nervously, tried to bridge again: “I actually studied physics. Minored in music so I wouldn't forget piano. Took a year to just play never looked back.”\n\nHe cut in: “What kind of money you make doing that?”\n\nShe blinked. “Sorry?”\n\nHe repeated the question.\n\nShe dodged politely: “It varies.”\n\nHe nodded. “That’s what I figured.”\n\nShe asked about Netflix. He studied the menu.\n\nShe asked if anything looked good. He said, “Not really. Might just ask for a regular burger.”\n\nShe apologized said she should’ve checked if he liked seafood.\n\nHe said, “I do. It’s just overpriced.”\n\nShe replied, “Oh! I wasn’t expecting you to pay.”\n\nHe grinned, “So you’re paying? Cool, maybe I’ll get something else.”\n\nShe laughed, waiting for him to laugh back. He didn’t.\n\n“Oh you were joking, right?”\n\nHe stared. “What joke?”\n\nShe quietly decided to stick with the wine. He blamed the slow service.\n\nShe asked about interests. He said, “Sports.”\n\nShe lit up. “Oh, what do you play?”\n\nHe said he used to play in high school. “Could’ve gone pro if I wanted.”\n\nShe asked, “What else?”\n\nShe offered a fun one: “Desert island book choice?”\n\nHe frowned. “Never been to the desert. I don’t really travel.”\n\nShe paused. Then said: “You know, I’m actually feeling off. I think I might have to call it a night.”\n\nHe shrugged. “Okay.”\n\nShe stood. “I’ll go settle this at the bar.”\n\nHe nodded. “Okay.”\n\nShe looked down, hesitant, then said, “Well… have a good night.”\n\nHe waved her off. “Yeah. You too. This was chill. I’ll text you.”\n\nShe walked out.\n\nHe stayed. Ordered his burger. Ate the whole thing.\n\nI watched this quiet unraveling of a one-sided effort, a hopeful human trying to connect with a brick wall of indifference, and I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Not because it was tragic or explosive but because of how common it felt. It’s like people aren’t just bad at dating these days they’re bad at showing up. Like someone handed them a life and they’re just dragging it around, not even curious about the person across the table.\n\nOf course, not everyone is like this. But I’m seeing it more especially among young men. They seem so unbothered, unmotivated, and disinterested in the people they’re with, like they’re just fulfilling a social quota.\n\nMaybe it’s burnout. Maybe loneliness. Or maybe some people are just not meant to date.\n\nAnyway, if you made it this far, thanks for listening. I just needed to get this one out of my head.",
