  "description": "Publix was packed today everyone panic-buying for the hurricane. I’m in line with my wife when I notice a dad and his daughter at the register. His card wasn’t going through. He kept checking his phone like maybe the money would magically appear. You could see he was embarrassed. His daughter was just quietly watching it all.\n\nEventually the cashier calls the manager, they void the transaction, and the two of them start walking out no groceries, just that heavy kind of silence.\n\nI couldn’t watch that.\n\nTold my wife, “I gotta do something,” and slipped out of line. I asked the manager, “Was it a payment issue? I’ll take care of it.” She nodded.\n\nI caught the guy right before he hit the door. “Hey man, come back in. Let me get that for you.”\n\nHe looked stunned. Like I’d offered him a million bucks and a nap.\n\nThey’d already started putting his groceries back, so I asked the staff to hold off and swiped my card. $63 and some change. Totally worth it.\n\nHe tried to pay me back with a few bucks. I said no. He hugged me. A real, tight, grateful hug. His daughter gave me a shy smile like I just handed her a puppy.\n\nMy wife? Crying in the parking lot.\n\nWe talk about being decent people. That was my shot. I’m glad I took it.\n\nBe that person when the moment comes. Someone might just need their faith in people restored.",
