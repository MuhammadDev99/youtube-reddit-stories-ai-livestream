  "description": "So I’ve been trying to get my life together a bit and started going for early morning runs. I’m not some fitness freak like I just needed something to clear my head before work. I usually leave around 6:30am with my headphones in and a simple hoodie.  \nAnyways a couple weeks ago or so this guy from my building saw me heading out and asked if I was going for a run. I said yeah and he was like “cool maybe I’ll join sometime.” I didn’t think he meant it to be completely honest. But the next day he was out there waiting for me at like 6:35am or something so I was like okay sure lets go. Now it's been two weeks and somehow we’re up to five people. One guy brought a friend and a woman from the second floor joined as well. Someone even made a group chat and I just got added to it like I’m the organizer. Someone called it a club yesterday. It’s hilarious because two months ago I was still in my robe most mornings like sipping sad coffee and messing around on rolling riches trying to chase a dopamine hit before work and look at me now lol. I'm not like a crazy freak when it comes to running, but like now I feel like I have a responsibility and I have to show up because I started all of this. Life's crazy!",
