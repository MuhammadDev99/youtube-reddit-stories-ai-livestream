  "description": "So on Valentine’s Day, I ordered flowers for this girl I’d been kind of seeing. Nothing super serious, but I thought it’d be a nice gesture. Just something small.\n\nI was in a rush and typed her address too fast. Didn’t even notice I mixed up two numbers in her apartment. Hit place order and went on with my day. Got the delivery confirmation a couple hours later but no text. No thank you, no these are beautiful nothing. Just silence.\n\nNext day, still nothing. By day three, I figured alright, cool, guess that’s over. Kinda sucked but whatever. Then someone knocked on my door.\n\nThis woman’s standing there with the flowers in her hands. I didn’t recognize her at first.\n\nShe goes, Hey these showed up at my place. I almost threw them out but they were too pretty. Figured I’d try to get them to the right person. I was like Oh. Wow. Yeah. Those were for someone who didn’t really answer.\n\nShe smiled and said, Their loss.\n\nAnd then, before leaving she kinda laughed and said, “You’ve got good taste though. If you ever need help picking out flowers again, I’m right down the hall.”\n\nI stood there like an idiot holding these now very awkward flowers thinking… did that just happen?\n\nNext day I sent her a new bouquet. Just some simple yellow tulips with a note that said\n\nThought you deserved your own.\n\nThat afternoon, she slid a sticky note under my door. It said\n\nDo you send flowers to all your neighbors or was I just lucky?\n\nWe ended up grabbing coffee that weekend. Talked for like two and a half hours without even realizing it. Then we did it again. And again.\n\nNow it’s almost a year later. We’re still together. She still teases me about not knowing how to type an address. I still get her tulips every once in a while, especially when I have no idea what else to do.\n\nFunny how one wrong number turned out to be the right one.",
