  "description": "So, this is a pretty wild situation, and I’m not sure if I’m handling it the right way. I (35F) have been married to my husband, John (38M), for ten years. Over the past few years, I’ve discovered that he’s been cheating on me with multiple women. It’s been devastating, but I’ve felt trapped because I have no income of my own and no way to support myself if I leave him.\n\nOne day, I had an idea. Instead of confronting him or leaving right away, I decided to turn the situation to my advantage. I started encouraging his affairs, subtly suggesting that he spend more time with these women and even helping him plan dates. I figured if he was going to cheat, I might as well benefit from it.\n\nI took it a step further by reaching out to the women he was seeing. I told them that if they wanted to continue their relationship with John, they would need to give me a 50% cut of whatever he spent on them—whether it was money, gifts, or other perks. Surprisingly, they agreed. They were so infatuated with him that they didn’t mind sharing the benefits with me.\n\nI started asking John for money for various things—shopping, spa days, even vacations. He was so wrapped up in his affairs that he didn’t notice how much I was spending. I saved every penny I could, building up a secret fund for myself.\n\nAfter a year of this, I finally had enough money to support myself. I filed for divorce, citing his infidelity as the reason. When he found out, he was furious and accused me of using him. I told him that if he hadn’t cheated, none of this would have happened.\n\nNow, some of my friends think I’m a genius for turning the tables on him, while others think I’m just as bad as he is for essentially “pimping him out” and taking advantage of the situation. I don’t feel guilty because I did what I had to do to survive and secure my future.\n\nSo, AITA for pimping out my husband to the women he cheats on me with, taking a 50% cut, and divorcing after getting enough money to support myself?",
