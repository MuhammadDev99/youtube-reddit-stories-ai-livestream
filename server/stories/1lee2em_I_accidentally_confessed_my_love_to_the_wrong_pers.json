  "description": "So my last story about IKEA just blowned up , so I thought, I should share something about my personal life.\n\nOkay, buckle up because I swear this sounds like a Wattpad story, but it actually happened.\n\nAbout a 7 year ago, I 25 was *madly* in love with my best friend (let’s call him Sam). We had one of those painfully close friendships where everyone assumed we were already together. I had written a long, emotional message one night where I finally poured out everything how I’d fallen for him, how I couldn’t keep pretending to just be friends, and how terrified I was to lose him if he didn’t feel the same.\n\nThe plan was to sit on it, proofread the next day, and *maybe* send it after a bottle of courage. Instead, sleepy-me hit send… not to Sam… but to my classmate *Dan* a guy I barely knew outside of group projects.\n\nCue the full-body panic. I immediately tried to unsend it, but it was too late. Dan had read it. Then came his reply:\n\n\"Wow. I don’t think this was meant for me... but if it *was* I feel the same way.\"\n\nI was *mortified*. I explained the situation, apologized, and tried to laugh it off, but Dan wasn’t joking. He said my message made his heart race. That he had noticed me for months. That maybe fate was being weirdly generous.\n\nWe went for coffee a few days later just to clear the air. That \"coffee\" lasted 5 hours. We haven’t stopped talking since.\n\nI never did confess to Sam. We drifted naturally, and I realized maybe the idea of him was bigger than the reality. Meanwhile, Dan has been my safe place, my partner, my person for 7 whole years.\n\nLife is *so* weird. But sometimes, the wrong message finds the right person.\n\n**TL;DR:** Tried to confess to my best friend. Sent it to a random classmate by accident. We’re now celebrating our 3-year anniversary.\n\nEDIT - In title it was 7years, i accidently wrote it 3 :(.",
