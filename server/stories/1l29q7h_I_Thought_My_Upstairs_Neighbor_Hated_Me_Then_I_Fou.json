  "description": "I live on the second floor of a three-story apartment building, aka the “anxiety sandwich zone.” Every sound from above or below feels like it’s happening *inside* my skull.\n\nFor the longest time, I thought my upstairs neighbor hated me. Not for anything I did—just... in general.\n\nShe moved in during the pandemic. Never said hi. Wore big headphones. Dropped things constantly. I’d hear random thuds at 3 a.m., like someone losing a Jenga match in slow motion. Once, something rolled across her floor for a full thirty seconds. Who rolls something for that long? What was it? A bowling ball? A watermelon?\n\nAnyway.\n\nA few weeks in, I started leaving my shoes at the door and walking in socks. Just in case *she* could hear *me*. I turned my music down. Started closing cabinets more gently. I even felt guilty sneezing too loud. (Which is wild—imagine apologizing for sneezing in your own apartment.)\n\nAnd then the worst thing happened.\n\nOne night I accidentally dropped a full glass of water in the kitchen. Loud crash. Glass everywhere. I cleaned it up fast, but I was convinced she’d come downstairs and yell. Or file a noise complaint. Or both.\n\nBut instead?\n\nThe next morning, I found a Post-it stuck to my door. Yellow, slightly crumpled, handwriting like a teacher’s.\n\nHey! Hope you’re okay—I heard a crash last night. Just wanted to check in. I drop stuff all the time too. No judgment 😊 - Apt 3C\n\nReader, I melted.\n\nThis woman I’d invented an entire villain arc for... was just *me*, but one floor up.\n\nLater that week, I baked banana muffins (box mix, let’s not pretend I’m a hero) and left some in front of her door with a note: “From your equally clumsy neighbor.”\n\nShe sent me a voice note later: “These are amazing. Also, I’m pretty sure the rolling sound you heard last week was a cantaloupe. Long story.”\n\nNow we talk occasionally. Trade leftovers. Send each other memes. Still haven’t met in person, but somehow it feels like I’ve made a friend—just through walls and floorboards and scribbled notes.\n\nAnd yeah. She still drops things at 3 a.m.\n\nBut now, I just laugh and think: *Same, girl. Same.*\n\n  \nEdit: Yes, I used AI to help narrate it better, but the story's real, and so are the feelings. Let people tell things how they want.",
