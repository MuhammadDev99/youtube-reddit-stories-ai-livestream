  "description": "Today i had to make a trip to the ER due to severe stomach pain. After a few hours and a CAT scan, it was found that i’m just.. full of sh*t. Literally. The nurse said (after giving suggestions of actual\nmedicines too) that rubbing my stomach in a clockwise direction would help things along, so when we got home he asked if he could do that for me. \n\nAs someone who hates having their tummy touched at all due to trauma and body image issues, it was hard, but i let him. And he was so gentle with me. \n\nI have finally found someone who i am comfortable with rubbing my tummy. i love him. \n\nEdit: alright, a few things. \n1) No, i didn’t think it was constipation. I have regular BMs daily. \n2) I eat plenty of fruits/vegetables and drink water.\n3) As stated in the post, actual medication was suggested to me, not just the rubbing.\n4) never thought i’d see backlash on me using the word tummy. if you don’t like it, to them i say, womp womp.",
