  "description": "My uncle was one of the smartest people I’ve ever met. He had a PhD in physics and spent most of his career working for NASA in the 70s and 80s. He wasn’t an astronaut, but he was heavily involved in research and development for space missions.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I asked him the big question: “Did we really land on the moon?”\n\nHe didn’t laugh, didn’t roll his eyes—just gave me this tired smile and said, “Kid, if you knew how many people it takes to fake something like that, you’d realize it’s easier to just go to the damn moon.”\n\nThat answer has stuck with me ever since.",
