  "description": "My(27f) boyfriend(23m) has been really romantic lately. I got home this morning and he was in a really good mood when I picked him up in the afternoon. \n\nHe showered when we got home and went to a park. We walked around for a while and went to the aquarium(the aquarium is on the park grounds). We grabbed dinner at a restaurant near by and we found a nice spot to watch the sunset afterward. Today was perfect. My boyfriend is always romantic, but lately, he's dialing up the romance and I love it. We just got back home and we're relaxing on the couch. We're watching a movie and we have all the lights off, just candles. It's so romantic, I feel so happy when I'm with him.\n\nEdit: my boyfriend is a construction worker. That's why he showered when he got home.\n\nUpdate: He proposed",
