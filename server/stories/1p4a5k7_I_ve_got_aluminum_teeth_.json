  "description": "I don't know how this happened, but I was in the vegetable section today, with my wife, and we were looking for Ambrosia Apples.\n\nI found them first and gave her a shout,  \"I got 'em here!\"\n\nI was loud enough to be rude to the twenty-something couple who were standing in front of me, filling their bag with Ambrosias too!\n\nI should have said I was sorry, but instead, I asked, \"Have you tried these? They're the bomb!\"\n\nAnd the woman exclaimed, \"They're very good!\"\n\nI continued, \"I cut off the tops, scoop out the insides, and stuff them with granola and honey, then I bake them.\"\n\nThe woman asked, \"But you eat them raw too, don't you?\n\nMy wife had joined us by then and she piped in, \"O - Def - every morning!\"\n\nI faced the woman and said, \"Not me, I don't eat raw apples\"\n\nAnd she said, \"Why not?\"\n\nI reached up, flicked my thumbnail to my teeth with a click and said, \"I've got aluminum teeth! I don't eat hard apples anymore.\"\n\nAnd then, this twenty something woman, looks at me, smiles, and says, \"It happens.\"\n\nAnd I swear she was missing her four or so front teeth. I can't be sure, but I didn't see any enamel at all, top or bottom.\n\nHer husband, too, seemed mildly amused but quick to get away. \n\nMy wife didn't notice the teeth. I think it was just a major coincidence.",
