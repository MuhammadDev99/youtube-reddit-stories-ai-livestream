  "description": "My husband has a \"work wife\", they are friends who go out to lunch often and tease each other and talk about some personal things. She brings him homemade lunches sometimes and he's brought her left over desserts (that I made!). It didn't bother me at first, but it feels like she has a connection to him that I don't.\n\nTo make matters worse she \"work-proposed\" to him to \"make their work-relationship work-official\", she playfully feels like he's not a real work husband if they don't have an actual work wedding. He thinks it's hilarious, and their manager said it's a fine excuse to throw a party out of their pizza party funds--they throw celebratory parties somewhat often when they ship a product or land a big client. The parties are usually a few grand in food and drinks and entertainment. His company is a dream come true but I think him and his friend are taking this too far. He was planning on wearing his normal work clothes to the \"wedding\" but there's rumors she's going to wear her wedding dress from her failed marriage (she's been divorced for 5 years).\n\nWhat should I do? I told him this is ridiculous but he keeps talking me down.  I'm considering showing up to respectfully voice my concerns during the \"if anyone has objections\" part of the ceremony. His coworkers know me from the last Christmas party and the time I had to bring him a clean pair of pants so I know they'd let me into the party. It's in the middle of the day so I'd need to take time off work but if I can stop their marriage maybe I can save mine.",
