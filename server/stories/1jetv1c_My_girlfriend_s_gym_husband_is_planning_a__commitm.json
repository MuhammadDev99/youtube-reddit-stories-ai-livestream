  "description": "My girlfriend has a \"gym husband\"—a guy she met at the gym who spots her, helps with her workouts, and apparently “keeps her accountable.” They text about workouts, meal plans, and random life stuff. He even brings her protein shakes sometimes, and she once gave him one of my extra lifting belts because “he needed one.” It didn’t bother me much at first, but now I feel like they have a connection I don’t.\n\nNow, he wants to have a commitment ceremony to celebrate their “fitness partnership” and how far they’ve come in their training. He says it’s just for fun and a way to stay motivated, but she’s been weirdly into it—talking about getting matching gym outfits and inviting their whole lifting group. Apparently, there’s even going to be a “vow” moment where they promise to push each other to their goals.\n\nShe swears it’s a joke, but their gym owner is letting them use the space, and their trainer is officiating. I told her this is ridiculous, but she keeps brushing me off. I’m seriously considering showing up to the ceremony and objecting when they ask if anyone has concerns. Am I crazy, or is this as weird as it sounds?\n\nPart 2 in profile",
