  "description": "It sounds unbelievable, but that’s exactly what happened. Just before the interview, I felt an urgent need to use the bathroom but hoped I could hold it for the 10 minutes before the interview. I was mistaken. I had a severe stomach issue and ended up having a bowel movement right before the interview. I cleaned myself up quickly and joined the call, but I was still dealing with the aftermath.\n\nDuring the interview with the COO, I could hear my stomach making loud noises, and I was sweating from the discomfort. I hoped it would end quickly, but the COO kept asking questions. Eventually, I couldn’t hold it any longer and soiled myself during the interview.\n\nDespite the unfortunate situation, the COO said I was a great fit for the position and offered me a job with a three times higher salary than my previous one, along with excellent benefits. I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at that point. I ended the call, had to replace my chair, and will likely share this story with my grandchildren in the future. It was a terrible experience but ended with an incredible outcome.",
