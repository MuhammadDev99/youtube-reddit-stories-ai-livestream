  "description": "So, my best friend, Matt, has always been a hopeless romantic. The kind of guy who believes in soulmates, sends good morning texts unironically, and probably watched The Notebook too many times.\n\nA few months ago, he met this girl, Lisa, on a dating app. She was perfect. Too perfect. Gorgeous, funny, into the same weird indie bands as him, and—get this—she actually laughed at his terrible puns.\n\nWithin weeks, they were inseparable. Lisa was always around, but something felt off. She never let him take pictures of her. She never talked about her job, just said she was “in government work.” And she always paid in cash.\n\nOne night, we were at a bar, and Matt stepped away to take a call. Lisa, left alone with me, leaned in and said, \"You seem like a good friend. Make sure Matt stays out of trouble.\"\n\nUh… what?\n\nThen, two days later, she just vanished. Poof. Phone disconnected. Apartment emptied out. Matt was devastated, thought she ghosted him. He spiraled HARD.\n\nThen, about a month later, we were watching the news. And there she was. Lisa. Except her real name was Special Agent Lauren Carter, and she was testifying in some huge undercover sting involving a money laundering ring.\n\nMatt had been dating an FBI agent working a case. And the best part? He wasn’t even the target—she was just using him as a cover story.\n\nTo this day, he refuses to use dating apps.",
