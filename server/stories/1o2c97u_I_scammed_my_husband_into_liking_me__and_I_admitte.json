  "description": "Admitted in my vows, actually, in front of all of our guests. \n\nJust kidding! \n\nFor me, it was love at first sight for my (now) husband. Not so much for him. I was his little sisters friend, with braces, and constant teen girl giggling. He was the older, much much hotter, couldn’t-care-less older brother down the hall. I obviously had no shot. \n\nLater, we met again through mutual friends, now both older, no headgear. I was just as in love, he was still just as cute, and this time I actually had a chance - I wasn’t going to blow it. I invited him to hang at my place after a friends birthday party and…. \n\nI had staged the place. I had casually left out a T-shirt of his favorite football team. You know, just tossed on the back of a chair. Oops! How did that get there? I left a CD of his favorite band on my nightstand, because obviously, that’s what any casual fan does. I love them too, duh! I had his favorite drink waiting in the fridge. Suuuuper casual. \n\nWas I a complete weirdo for doing this? Yes. Did it work perfectly? Also yes. It also made for a perfect wedding story. \n\nHis sister (a bridesmaid) was only a little annoyed to find out I was using our hangouts as study sessions on her older brother. (Just kidding - she thought it was hilarious &amp; knew all her friends thought he was cute obviously). \n\n\nETA: to the people who think this is weird - 1. I already owned the shirt (local school, my dad’s shirt) &amp; CD because I genuinely liked them, I just made sure they were visible. Also we were so young lol 2. I don’t care! I’m into my husband, sue me.  The title is obvs a joke",
