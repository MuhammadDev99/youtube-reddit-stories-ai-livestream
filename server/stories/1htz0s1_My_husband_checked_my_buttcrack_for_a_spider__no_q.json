  "description": "My husband and I had just turned the lights off to go to bed and were scrolling quietly on our phones. I had a blanket over my legs and swore I felt something crawl across my leg.. I quickly pulled up the cover and used my phone light to see what it was: a bug that looked like a spider! \n\nI started screaming, my husband and I both fly out of bed and turned the lights on. I can barely talk I’m still screaming. We are ripping off the blankets, looking on the sides of the bed, doing the most to find that mf. \n\nIn my panic and creepy crawling feelings, I pulled my pants down, turned around, and spread my cheeks yelling “CHECK MY ASS”!! \n\nHe actually pulled out a flashlight, just to make sure there was no spider in my crack. \n\nAbout 2 min later, we see that MF crawling again in the middle of the bed (how this happened we have no idea) and my husband squashed it with a croc. Needless to say we changed the bedding and very slowly got back into bed. \n\n*we live in the country so spiders, although rare, are sometimes out of our control* \n\nWe still laugh about this to this day 🤣",
