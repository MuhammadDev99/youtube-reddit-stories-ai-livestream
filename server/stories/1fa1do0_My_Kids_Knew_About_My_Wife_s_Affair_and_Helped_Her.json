  "description": "Last week while my wife (49F) was taking a shower I (50M) saw a notification pop up on her phone and went to open it thinking it was one of our daughter’s (Maddy 24F and Alice 26F) confirming what time their girl’s dinner was. \n\nInstead I saw an unsaved number saying “I can’t wait to see you!” And then kissing emoji. I froze for a second. I clicked on the message and saw a short thread mostly confirming dinner plans for that evening and how they missed each other and once a week just wasn’t enough. I knew what I saw. 29 years of marriage down the drain. \n\nHoping to catch her in a lie before she left the house, I texted both our daughters and asked them about girls dinner. What happened next broke me to my core. Both girls confirmed the dinner and said they were excited. I couldn’t believe it. \n\nNot proud of what came next. I turned her location sharing on with me in her phone and let her leave. I followed her to a restaurant and lo and behold neither daughter was there but instead a man I knew was her boss. I was so heartbroken. Part of me was hoping I was just a paranoid freak and my daughters would be there happy to see me! But no, just my cheating wife and her AP. I took pictures of the two of them holding hands, and kissing. I know I should have waited but I couldn’t help myself, I was so angry. As soon as I got in my car, I opened the group chat we had as a family, sent them all the photos and said “Glad you’re enjoying girls dinner together!”\n\n\nI then turned my phone off and drove to my brothers house and asked to stay the night. I woke up the next morning to over 40 texts and 20 voicemails. \n\nMy wife went through the cheaters playbook of excuses. I didn’t even listen to her voicemails. I was about to respond with: “I will be getting a divorce, I recommend a lawyer.” But my brother stopped me. He told me to meet with a bunch of lawyers first and make sure she couldn’t use them. \n\nInstead I just sent the group chat a simple message: “I am physically fine, but need time. I will come home when I’m ready.” I then muted my phone. \n\nI called different lawyers that looked to be the best in town that morning for appointments. Met with all of them, and picked the one who looked ready to treat this as scorched earth as possible. \n\nFinally after spending all day with lawyers, I looked through the messages and both my daughters were apologizing. My younger daughter, the daddy’s girl of the two, was manic. She had texted me almost 50 times saying she never should have lied and hated it every time. Her boyfriend even reached out asking me to please reach out to her, that he didn’t know what was going on but that she was on the verge of a panic attack. \n\n“Maddy, I love you but please understand that what you’ve done has hurt me deeply, I need you to give me space.” \n\nI sent it and within seconds got a “okay, I’m so sorry, I never should have helped, I’ll never forgive myself. I love you too.”\n\nI didn’t respond. Alice was different. We always had a good relationship but she was a momma’s girl through and through. She said she was sorry but that I shouldn’t throw away a good marriage because of one mistake. This made me furious. \n\n“Alice, this isn’t a mistake, this is a betrayal. From my whole family. Please don’t reach out again until I make first contact.”\n\nShe never responded but I know she showed it to me STBX because she started saying that I shouldn’t take this out on Alice. I never responded. I’ll never talk to her again except through lawyers. \n\nThis all happened 5 days ago. I’m still at my brothers and can’t contain my feelings. I cry every morning and most of the day. I oscillate between complete dipilitating sadness and all-consuming anger. Losing my wife will be hard enough but how do I ever look at my children again? How do I even begin to forgive them? Alice is supposed to get married in the fall, I’ve been paying for almost everything, now I’m probably not going to go. \n\nI don’t even know how to move forward. I am completely destroyed. \n\n\nUpdate: https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/s/csLL5xrC4x",
