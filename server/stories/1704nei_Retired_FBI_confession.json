  "description": "I used to work in a medical procedures unit in a hospital in the PNW. Patients would undergo endoscopic exams, which they were sedated for. We had an elderly gentleman patient this case and while we waited for the Doctor to arrive we engaged in friendly chit chat, nothing out of the ordinary. When the doc came in, he immediately asked us if the patient told us his history. I started rattling off the medical reasons why he was having the procedure and the doc cut me off saying “no his past work history as an undercover FBI mob agent”. Naturally my reaction was “ohhhhh no.. that must have been interesting, dealing with those mob guys”. The patients response has haunted me to this day. His exact words.\n\n“Those guys weren’t as bad as those mother fucking politicians” \n\nHe then went on to tell a story about how he was head of security for a “congressional event” in the 80s. He said another agent handed him the phone saying “congressman” wants to speak with you. \n\nThe conversation went as follows:\n\nCongressman: Will there be women there?\n\nAgent: Not sure what you mean.. but yes women are here.\n\nCongressman: When I arrive I want one sent to my room.. “NO OLDER THAN 13”.\n\nRight after he said that the CRNA pushed the meds and he passed out. We all just stood there in silence while he underwent the procedure.. what the fuck did he just tell us?\n\nEDIT: Apparently people are getting hung up on the use of the term “informant”.. so I removed it. For clarity, which I thought might have been deduced.. this old man was not a “Mob Informant” in the sense of being a snitch in the mob. He was a retired FBI agent who worked undercover with the mob at one point. In a completely separate point in time, he claimed to have been asked by a congressman for a 13 year old girl. This man had no reason to lie.. he didn’t even bring it up, the surgeon did.\n\nEDIT 2: \n\nThe story is 100% true as it happened.\n\nCould the old man be lieing, yes of course. Do I think he was, NO!\n\nThe procedure was an EGD “upper endoscopy”\n\nIt was a surgeon doing post operative surveillance, not a gastroenterologist.\n\nYou nay sayers need to understand that elite pedophile rings exist and have existed for a very long time. \n\nPeople taking this as a push for a political world view are wrong. I don’t have a political affiliation.\n\nFor everyone claiming “The FBI doesn’t work security or doesn’t work with congress. You are assuming you know what capacity this guy was working at every point of his career??\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI_Police#:~:text=The%20FBI%20Police%20is%20tasked,certain%20laws%20and%20administrative%20regulations.\n\n“Duties and responsibilities”\n\n“The FBI Police may be occasionally deployed to significant national security events, such as presidential inaugurations, the Super Bowl, conferences of world leaders as well as major political party conferences.”",
