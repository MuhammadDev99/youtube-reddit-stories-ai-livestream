  "description": "So i was with M for 3 years and for me everything was fine. We were the classic couple always together, doing everything together, going everywhere together and all this stuff just like she wants and for me it was ok. \n\nBut everything changed 2 months ago when i discovered that she was cheating on me with one of my friends.\n\nAfter that i discovered the cheating i don't made any type of scene, i never screamed, i never cried or anything of this things that i hate. I just told her that we were over and we immediatly broke up.\n\nOf course she tried to change my mind with tears, begged me for forgivness, tried to hug me but i always refused because cheating is the only thing i will never forgive to anyone. \n\nShe spent 2 months on stalking me on social media with fake accounts, she tried to contact me with new numbers and even made all her friends to contact me but i had always refused to do anything for her. \n\nI wasn't even mad i was just in shock and couldn't believe that she did that to me since i have done everything i could for her. I always made her surprises, expensive and not gifts, we were going to vacations in beautiful places, i was romantic with her bringing flowers, chocolate, making her special meals, i even took cooking classes for her so the cheating came out of the blue for me. I love to work out so my physique isn't a problem and even sex wasn't a problem because i heard her many times with her female friends saying how lucky she was to find a guy that can satisfay her. \n\nAnyway 1 month ago i bought a new car becuase my old one was having serious problems and the mechanic, a family friend, told me clearly to get rid of it because the cost of maintenance was too high so i did.\n\nI bought my new car and installed some cameras and a security sistem inside because since is new and is very expensive i wanted it to be protected.\n\nSo 3 weeks ago at morning i found out my brand new car being completely destroyed, broken windows, striped everywhere and with a note on the front \"please i just want to talk with you\". I immediatly knew that she was the one that made all the disaster and the cameras recorded that too.\n\nThe same day i went to the police with the proofs to sue her and after a few days i recieved a message from a new number where she was bagging me to withdraw the complaint because she was having a job interview and if they knew about it she would had lost the opportunity for the job. \n\nI never replied to her messages in this months and i nver will and of course i'm not withdrawing the complaint. \n\nIt's been 2 weeks that she is calling me and messaging me to withdraw the complaint but i will nver do it because for me any action have consequencies and you must think before of the action about the consequence and not after begging. It don't work with me.\n\nSo, at the end, my ex will not have her job and i will have my car repaired and for me everything is fine altought she is still messaging and calling me but i will never change my mind.",
