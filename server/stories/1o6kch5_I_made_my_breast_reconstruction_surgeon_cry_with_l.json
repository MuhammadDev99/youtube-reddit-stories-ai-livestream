  "description": "After the long process of a double mastectomy, I finally got my permanent breast implants in, and was very happy with them. As a bonus, I discovered that since they were put directly on top of my chest muscles, I could do a neat trick!\n\nI can “twerk” my breasts one at a time or together, making them dance quite vigorously!\n\nI went for my checkup and said, Hey Doc, look what I can do now…and showed off their bouncy dancing skills.\n\nHe literally dropped his chart and bent over laughing until tears came into his eyes. He said I was the first patient to do that to him, and he couldn’t stop laughing the rest of the visit. \n\nI encourage other patients of this type of surgery to try it, it’s quite fun and entertaining.\n\nEdit: thanks for the kind comments and award, guess I can say I won an award for bouncing my boobies now.\n\nNote: for those who say video or it didn't happen, I get it, but I'm not going to post my boobs all over the internet!",
