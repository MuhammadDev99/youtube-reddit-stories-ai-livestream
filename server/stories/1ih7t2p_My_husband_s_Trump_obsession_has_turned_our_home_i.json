  "description": "I never thought I'd be posting here, but I desperately need to vent. My husband of 12 years has transformed from a reasonable conservative into what I can only describe as a Trump cult member, and it's destroying our marriage.\n\nOur house has become a literal shrine to Trump. I wish I was exaggerating. There's a 6-foot Trump cardboard cutout in our living room that he talks to every morning like some sort of religious ritual. Our walls, once decorated with family photos, are now plastered with Trump flags. He even replaced our American flag with a \"Trump 2024 or Death\" banner. My kids are embarrassed to have friends over.\n\nLast week was the final straw. He spent $3,000 of our savings on \"limited edition\" Trump gold-plated coins and a \"certified authentic\" piece of Mar-a-Lago toilet paper. THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. When I confronted him about taking money from our children's college fund, he said \"Trump University will be reopened and make education great again.\" I couldn't make this shit up if I tried.\n\nEvery dinner conversation somehow turns into a Trump sermon. He'll randomly shout \"STOP THE STEAL\" during family meals. When our 15-year-old daughter got an A+ on her history project about the Civil War, he accused her teacher of being a \"communist infiltrator\" for not teaching \"the truth about Trump's victory.\"\n\nOur bedroom... God, I'm mortified to even type this. He insists on keeping a giant Trump portrait above our bed because \"Trump watches over us.\" He even got a Trump tattoo on his chest and keeps trying to convince me to get one too. He calls it his \"Mark of Patriotism.\"\n\nHis entire personality has been consumed. He changed his wardrobe to only red clothing. He refers to himself as a \"Digital Soldier\" and spends hours posting on Truth Social. When I asked him to help with our son's homework, he said he was too busy \"fighting the deep state online.\"\n\nThe paranoia is getting worse. He installed cameras around our house to \"watch for Antifa.\" He thinks our neighbors are \"deep state agents\" because they have a pride flag. He threw out our coffee maker because \"Starbucks is funding the radical left.\" He even accused our golden retriever of being \"suspiciously woke\" because she didn't bark at a Biden commercial.\n\nOur sex life? He insists on playing Trump rally speeches in the background and keeps trying to get me to wear a Melania mask. I wish I was joking. He has different MAGA hats for different occasions - including one specifically for \"bedroom patriot time.\" I'm dying inside.\n\nI found receipts showing he's donated over $15,000 to various Trump-related causes this year alone. Money we needed for our mortgage. When I showed him our overdue bills, he said \"Trump will fix the economy and make us rich.\" We're facing foreclosure, but he keeps buying Trump merchandise.\n\nYesterday, he announced he's legally changing his name to \"Donald J. Trump Smith\" and wants our kids to follow suit. Our 10-year-old son started crying, and my husband told him \"real patriots don't cry\" and made him watch four hours of rally footage as \"testosterone training.\"\n\nI've tried everything - marriage counseling (he called the therapist a socialist), family interventions (he disowned his own mother for suggesting he get help), even pleading with his Trump-supporting friends to tell him he's going too far. Nothing works. He just goes deeper into the rabbit hole.\n\nThe worst part? Under all this Trump worship, I know my real husband is still in there somewhere. Sometimes, late at night, I catch glimpses of the man I married. But then morning comes, he puts on his MAGA hat, salutes the Trump cutout, and the cycle begins again.\n\nEdit: Please stop DMing me about joining your \"Trump Wives Support Group.\" I appreciate the thought, but I'm not interested in your MLM scheme selling Trump-themed essential oils.\n\nEdit 2: Yes, I've already hidden our important documents and started a secret savings account. And no, I won't sell you his \"rare\" Trump toilet paper, even if you're offering Bitcoin.\n\nEdit 3: To the people saying \"this can't be real\" - I wish I was creative enough to make this up. Come visit for dinner sometime. Hope you like hamberders while watching Tucker Carlson reruns on loop.",
