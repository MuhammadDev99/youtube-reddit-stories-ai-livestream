  "description": "I was on the bus this morning and the driver was already a little behind schedule. Right as he was about to pull away, he noticed an elderly woman slowly making her way toward the stop. Instead of leaving, he waited. Not just a few seconds he waited a full five minutes. Other passengers started grumbling under their breath. You could feel that quiet irritation people get when their routine is disrupted by anything unexpected. But the driver just said “that’s somebody’s grandma. We can wait.” The woman finally got on board, thanked him and he told her to take her time finding a seat. And the whole vibe of the bus shifted for a moment. You don’t see that kind of patience very often anymore. Later when I was trying to play a few rounds of jackpot city I kept thinking about that simple line \"that’s somebody’s grandma\". It really made me realize how often we treat schedules and efficiency as if they’re more important than actual people.\n\nIt really made me realize how often we treat schedules and efficiency as if they’re more important than actual people.\n\nThat driver chose kindness over the clock and it genuinely mattered.",
