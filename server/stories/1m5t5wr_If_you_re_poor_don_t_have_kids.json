You shouldn’t have a kid if you can’t support it. \n\nI was in Boston last night just walking around and I saw a homeless woman with her kid. Maybe 3-4 years old. And that was the saddest thing I’ve ever seen. Not only was this kid just on the ground with her mother , everybody was just walking past them. \n\nI bought a few meals and gave it to them but it was so sad I just drove home. \n\nChildren are a gift, yes. But if your having a kid you know you can’t take care of please reconsider. I mean man that hit me different I’m not gonna lie. \n\nEdit: I definitely should have added to the post my bad, but the woman was clearly a junkie. Looked like a methhead. It was just very sad to see. A lot of people are arguing that I wouldn’t know the situation they could have had, which is true. But her being messed up like that doesn’t give me much hope. Again I’ve should have added that \n\nEdit 2: , I contacted the shelters I volunteer at and they are going through the system to see if that family is in it, and if their not they will find them and help them. I did get the woman’s name but I’m not mentioning it in the post obviously. Y’all saying I’m trying to karma farm or something but I’m at-least  trying more than you are bum \n\nUPDATE: hey y’all, so my friends at the shelter did identify them. They are regulars at a specific shelter, so they are getting help. I probably just caught them at a bad time or when they just wanted to sit down. One of my friends explained their situation to me, she got injured awhile back in a car accident, basically became addicted to painkillers and went up the totem pole. Although she isn’t clean they are still seeking support so that’s the good news.",
