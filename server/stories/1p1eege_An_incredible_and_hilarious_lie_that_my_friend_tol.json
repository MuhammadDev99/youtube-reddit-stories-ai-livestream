  "description": "I had a friend in high school who was a pathological liar, and he once told an incredible lie that still sticks with me to this day. So I'm going to tell the story as he told it. \n\nHe claims that when he was 12, he took a test to get into a gifted youth physics program hosted over the summer at Columbia University, funded by Neil Degrasse Tyson. Because he got a 100% on the test, he got a full scholarship. \n\nDuring the program, he learned PhD level physics, and wrote an essay on the collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies. At the end of the summer he was given a certificate that allowed him to own small amounts of low grade uranium for personal use. \n\nI first found out about this when he texted me asking if I had a centrifuge, or some sort of machine that could deplete uranium. I said of course not, why? And he said he had uranium in his basement that he needed to get rid of. \n\nAs mentioned, he was a pathological liar and this was not the only lie he told, it was just the most interesting and detailed one. Thank you for listening.",
