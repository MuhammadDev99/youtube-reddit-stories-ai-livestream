  "description": "I(45f) adopted my son(21m) when he was 12. He came from an abusive household and it took him a little bit to warm up to me. I remember one day, my cousin(42m) was visiting. My son had only been with me for 6 months and he was still pretty reserved. I was worried about him and I was terrified that I was doing something wrong. And then my cousin said something that will always stay with me. My cousin said \"he's okay now, it's just taking him a bit to get comfortable because he's been through some things. He has a good mom now.\"\n\nMy son started warming up to me shortly after that and he's grown so much. I've noticed that he's been way happier and way less reserved And he's a firefighter now and I'm so proud of him. When I first adopted him he was this short, scrawny kid and now he's so tall. He's muscular now, too, because he's a firefighter. He was 5'4 when I first adopted him and now he's 6'2. I'm only 5'9 and I have to look up when I talk to him. He grew so much and it was so gradual that I didn't notice until recently. He has a kind soul and he's a genuinely good person. I'm so proud of the person he's become and who he is today.",
