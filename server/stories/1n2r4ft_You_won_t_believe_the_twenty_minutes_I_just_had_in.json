  "description": "You wont believe the twenty minutes I just had. So Im in the grocery store right its like 7pm and Im just staring at the wall of pasta sauces because I cant decide between marinara and arrabbiata you know the usual life crisis. This older lady comes up next to me and shes doing the same thing just staring. We stand there for a solid minute in complete silence.\nThen she just goes \"My husband left me for a woman who makes her own sauce from scratch.\" I didnt know what to say so I just blurted out \"Well her sauce probably isnt even that good.\" She looked at me and then she started laughing this kind of wheezy cry laugh and I started laughing too. We just stood there by the pasta sauce laughing like maniacs. I ended up buying the arrabbiata. I dont think I helped but it was a moment. You ever just have a weirdly human connection with a complete stranger in the most\nrandom place",
