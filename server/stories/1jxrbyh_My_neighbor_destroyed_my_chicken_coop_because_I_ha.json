  "description": "So I’ve  “m27” been living in this house for about 3 years. It’s not fancy, but it’s mine, and I’ve put a lot of love into it…. especially the backyard. Over time, I built a nice little setup.  pool, garden, and a small chicken coop. I have a neighbor named Dave. \nDave didn’t seem like a bad guy when I first moved in. A little quiet. Then I installed the pool. and everything changed.  Suddenly he started complaining about everything. the “mosquitoes” which makes no sense with chlorine. \nWhat I didn’t know right away was that a mutual friend of mine had an affair with Dave’s wife. I had no part in it, but Dave found out, and because I’m friends with the guy, he’s been holding a personal grudge against me ever since. I guess the pool was just the final straw in his head.\nFast forward to last week. I walk outside and see my chicken coop fucked up. Wire fencing ripped open, panels knocked down, feed spilled everywhere. One of my hens was missing and another had a broken wing.\nMy ring camera footage shows Dave, after midnight, stumbling into my yard with a shovel. Drunk off his ass, just smashing the coop like it wronged him personally.\n\nI called the cops. Filed a report. Animal cruelty, property damage, trespassing you name it. He tried to deny it until I told the officer I had video. Then he went silent.\n\nNow he’s avoiding me completely, but I hear him mumbling shit when I walk past. I’ve rebuilt the coop, reinforced everything, and the remaining chickens are okay. \n\nBut yeah—having a pool made him mad. The affair made him vengeful. And my poor chickens paid the price.\n\nPeople are wild.",
