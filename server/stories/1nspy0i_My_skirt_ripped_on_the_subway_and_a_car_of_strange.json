  "description": "Evening rush. I stood to give up my seat and the back of my pencil skirt snagged on a bolt. Pop. Cold air on my thigh. Heart pounding, I froze.\n\nA woman in scrubs pressed a sweatshirt into my hands. Another pulled safety pins from her tote. A man held his suit jacket as a shield. Someone angled a phone so I could see. In under a minute they pinned the seam and tied the sweatshirt. A soft laugh moved through the car.\n\nAt the next stop I stepped off and they gave me a wave like teammates. I walked the last blocks in a sweatshirt skirt with pins ticking and my chest felt lighter. People can be so good.",
