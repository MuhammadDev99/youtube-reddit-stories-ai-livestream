  "description": "When I was 22 (now 26) I was sitting on one of those train shuttles that take you to different terminals and minding my own business. Every seat on the shuttle is taken. I look up from my phone and see an elderly women came onboard with a cane and when she walked near me I stood up, smiled at her and offered her my seat. She looked at me smiling, looking relieved and said, “thank you, you are so kind, thank you” that part made me smile but what caught me off guard is the women sitting across from us (she must have been in her mid 30s, serious looking, East European accent) looks me up and down, looks directly in my eyes and says in a loud, matter of fact tone, “of course he is kind, he is a Gentleman” with an emphasis on the word “Gentleman” and in that moment I felt so confident, self-content, warm, and alive. I have never felt that way before and have not felt that way since. I simply smiled, thanked her, and went back to looking at my phone. Man, I still feel warm and happy when I think about it. I still occasionally get the opportunity to be a good person, like when I traded my seat on the plane so a pregnant women had the aisle seat and an easier access to the restroom, but nothing has compared.",
