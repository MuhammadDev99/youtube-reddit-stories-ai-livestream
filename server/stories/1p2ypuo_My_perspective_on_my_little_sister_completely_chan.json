  "description": "I’m a 22M and my sister is 19F. Growing up we were classic siblings, fighting over stupid things, scratching each other’s arms, then five minutes later playing Mario or stealing snacks together. She was my friend, my partner in chaos, the annoying little sister who also somehow made life fun.\n\nBut somewhere in our teenage years, I drifted away from her. I got my own friends, my own world, and I stopped making space for her in it. I didn’t hate her or anything… she was just “the girl in the house” in my mind. We barely talked except during dinner. And honestly, that distance It was mostly my fault.\n\nShe still tried. She’d buy me clothes sometimes. She’d start random conversations. She’d be excited to wish me happy birthday at 9AM while I sometimes forgot hers until late evening. I wasn’t rude, but I wasn’t a good brother either. Just… indifferent.\n\nThen I moved away for university, and the distance grew even more. Weeks, sometimes months without talking. Looking back, I don’t know what I was thinking. A few weeks ago everything changed.\n\nI needed to sort out a bunch of documents and renew some records in another cityaway. Timing was terrible because I got sick, like really not in the condition to handle all of it on my own. Out of nowhere, my sister stepped in.\n\nShe went to the offices for me, organized my files, handled the complicated parts I didn’t even understand. Stuff that would’ve taken me days… she finished so fast. And that’s when it hit me: in my head she was still the “kid sister.” But she’s not a kid anymore. She’s smart, responsible, grown up.\n\nShe even travelled with me for two days to help submit everything because I couldn’t manage it alone. She was just… there. Caring, calm, taking responsibility, making sure I was okay. And I felt this huge punch of guilt. Like , how was I so distant from someone who always tried to stay close\n\nI thanked her, but even that felt small compared to what she deserved. Now I keep thinking I want to rebuild this bond. I want to be the brother she actually deserves. I want to spend time with her, take her out for a sibling day, maybe buy her something nice, take her to a restaurant, just… show her I appreciate her. Also i love to travel lot, i could take her with me one destination, it will be fun\n\nBut I’m so awkward about it because I’ve never done that with her. \n\nEDIT \n\nWe live in the same home, I'm joined for my master's in my City so we live together\n\nI sent her this thread in a text. She’s probably at college or out with friends, but hopefully she sees it soon or comes home",
